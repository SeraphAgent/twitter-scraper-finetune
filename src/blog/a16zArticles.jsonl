{"text":"Marc Andreessen is able to explain himself so well that I should have less commentary to add to the quotations in this post than usual. But where is the fun in that? My primary task with this blog post has been assembling the quotations and placing them in an order which flows well, since understanding the earlier topics helps the reader understand ideas which come later in the list… #1 “The key characteristic of venture capital is that returns are a power-law distribution. So, the basic math component is that there are about 4,000 startups a year that are founded in the technology industry which would like to raise venture capital and we can invest in about 20.” “We see about 3,000 inbound referred opportunities per year we narrow that down to a couple hundred that are taken particularly seriously… There are about 200 of these startups a year that are fundable by top VCs. … about 15 of those will generate 95% of all the economic returns … even the top VCs write off half their deals.” I have done several posts on the fundamental forces which create power laws in venture capital. If you don’t understand the forces which create power laws in venture capital, you don’t truly understand venture capital. Power laws don’t happen by accident. There are always factors feeding back on themselves when something like investing results are reflected in a power law, and venture capital is no exception. Why power laws? To understand venture capital as well as many of the phenomena impacting individuals, companies and the global economy right now, you must understand cumulative advantage and its inverse cumulative disadvantage. Robert Merton has described cumulative advantage in this way: “exceptional performance … attracts new resources as well as rewards that facilitate continued high performance [repeat].” Additional ways that people use to describe this phenomenon include the Matthew effect, virtuous circles, and the rich get richer. Another important factor known as Path Dependence is used to describe at least three phenomenon: increasing returns, self-reinforcement, and positive feedback. Of course, it also the case in that failure can create negative feedback loops and vicious cycles which can make the poor get poorer. As was noted above, cumulative advantage and path dependence are operating and are self-reinforcing at every scale (e.g., individuals, startups, established businesses, communities, regions, nations and the global economy). #2 “We think you can draw a 2×2 matrix for venture capital. …And on one axis you could say, consensus versus non-consensus. And on the other axis you can say, successful or failure. And of course, you make all your money on successful and non-consensus. … it’s very hard to make money on successful and consensus. Because if something is already consensus then money will have already flooded in and the profit opportunity is gone. And so by definition in venture capital, if you are doing it right, you are continuously investing in things that are non-consensus at the time of investment. And let me translate ‘non-consensus’: in sort of practical terms, it translates to crazy. You are investing in things that look like they are just nuts.” “The entire art of venture capital in our view is the big breakthrough for ideas. The nature of the big idea is that they are not that predictable.” “Most of the big breakthrough technologies/companies seem crazy at first: PCs, the internet, Bitcoin, Airbnb, Uber, 140 characters.. It has to be a radical product. It has to be something where, when people look at it, at first they say, ‘I don’t get it, I don’t understand it. I think it’s too weird, I think it’s too unusual.’” This set of quotations reminds me of Howard Marks, who has said: “To achieve superior investment results, your insight into value has to be superior. Thus you must learn things others don’t, see things differently or do a better job of analyzing them — ideally all three.” The power laws in venture capital virtually guarantee that the poseur venture capitalist who follows the crowd can never make up for all their losers, since they will not get the one or two tape measure home runs required to generate returns that limited partners demand. What is perfectly advisable for the ordinary investor (“be the market”) spells doom for the venture capitalist because venture capital returns reflect the power law noted above. It is only in the non-consensus quadrants that optionality will be mis-priced and bargains found. Buying optionality is not enough to achieve success as a venture capitalist; it must be mis-priced. Paying too much of any asset including optionality is not a solvable problem. The matrix Marc Andreessen describes above, with an example in each quadrant, looks like this: #3 “You want to have as much ‘prepared mind’ as you possibly can. And learn as much as you can about as many things, as much as you can. You want to enter as close as you can to a zen-like blank slate of perfect humility at the beginning of the meeting saying ‘teach me’ … We try really hard to be educated by the best entrepreneurs.” This set of quotations from Marc Andreessen reminds me of a famous quote from Shunru Suzuki: “If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything, it is open to everything. In the beginner’s mind there are many possibilities, but in the expert’s mind there are few.” If you go into a meeting with a startup thinking you know everything, you will learn nothing. Similarly, if you think you can predict everything you will fail as a venture capitalist. Of course, not only must the idea of the investor be non-consensus it must also be right. Most things that seem nuts in fact are nuts. But every once in a while what seems nuts is one of the 15 ideas each year that 95% of financial returns in venture capital. #4 “You want to tilt into the really radical ideas… but by their nature you can’t predict what they will be.” “There will be certain points of time when everything collides together and reaches critical mass around a new concept or a new thing that ends up being hugely relevant to a high percentage of people or businesses. But it’s really really hard to predict those. I don’t believe anyone can.” This set of quotes describes the best way to deal with complex adaptive systems — rather than trying to predict the unpredictable, it is best to purchase a portfolio composed of mis-priced optionality. Warren Buffett describes a portfolio of bets with optionality in this way in his 1993 Chairman’s letter: “You may consciously purchase a risky investment — one that indeed has a significant possibility of causing loss or injury — if you believe that your gain, weighted for probabilities, considerably exceeds your loss, comparably weighted, and if you can commit to a number of similar, but unrelated opportunities.” Marc Andreessen describes his firm’s approach as being similar to Benchmark Capital and Arthur Rock (i.e., focus on big breakthrough ideas), which is unlike other venture firms that have a process where they try to create value-chain maps of where markets/the industry is going. #5 Venture capitalists “spend a lot of time talking about markets and technology…. and we have lots of opinions. …but the decision should be around people…. about 90% of the decision [is people].”… “We are looking for a magic combination of courage and genius .… Courage [“not giving up in the face of adversity”] is the one people can learn.” When you have a team of strong people in a startup, their ability to adapt and innovate gives the company and the investors optionality. Weak teams which can’t adapt to changing environments usually fail. Identifying the right people is all about pattern recognition. #6 “An awful lot of successful technology companies ended up being in a slightly different market than they started out in. Microsoft started with programming tools, but came out with an operating system. Oracle started doing contracts for the CIA. AOL started out as an online video gaming network.” Because the future is not predictable with certainty, companies with optionality in the form of strong teams and research & development capability can pivot into other markets. This can present a problems if you are a venture capitalist which has decided to only invest in one company per category. There is so much pivoting going on in consumer that some venture capitalists have stopped doing Series A rounds in that category. #7 “The great saving grace of venture capital is that our money is locked up. The big advantage that we have as a venture capital firm over a hedge fund or a mutual fund is we have a lock up on our money.” “So we invest in these companies with a ten-year outlook.” “And so enterprise can go in and out of fashion four different times, and we can go and invest in one of these companies, and it’s okay, because we can stay the course.” Another investor who has figured the value of locked up capital from investors is Warren Buffett, who famously closed his partnership and started Berkshire. Unlike a hedge fund, Warren Buffett’s capital is locked up protecting him from people trying to redeem after the panic during a market dip. Bruce Berkowitz: “That is the secret sauce: permanent capital. That is essential. I think that’s the reason Warren Buffett gave up his partnership. You need it, because when push comes to shove, people run.” The ability of a venture capital firm to have cash in the bank (or at least the ability to call on cash contractually promised by limited partners) allows it to invest through the downturns, which as my post on Michael Moritz explained, can be a very good time to start a company. Andreessen Horowitz itself is proof of that principle. Marc Andreessen has said: “The spring of 2009…. was not a time when investors wanted to hear about a new venture capital fund. In fact, many of the large investors in venture capital and private equity were in a liquidity crisis in their own businesses, including the big university endowments where they were having real trouble meeting their commitments back to their sponsoring organizations… people have told us it was the harshest, most hostile time to raise new capital funding in 40 years. Of course, we are contrarian or perverse, depending on how you look at it, and we said, Well, then it’s probably going to be a very good time to raise venture capital funding.” #8 “The thing all the venture firms have in common is they did not invest in most of the great successful technology companies.” “The mistakes that we make in a field like venture capital generally aren’t investing in something that turns out not to work. … it’s the big hit that you missed. And so every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in Google and didn’t just feels like an idiot. Every venture capitalist who had the opportunity to invest in Facebook and didn’t feels like an idiot. The challenge in the field is all of the great VCs over the last 50 years, the thing that they all have in common, is they all failed to invest in most of the big winners. And so this again is part of the humility in the profession.” Warren Buffett and Charlie Munger call this type of mistake an “error of omission” (i.e., what you don’t do can hurt you more than what you actually do). No one describes this category of mistake better than Charlie Munger: “The most extreme mistakes in Berkshire’s history have been mistakes of omission. We saw it, but didn’t act on it. They’re huge mistakes — we’ve lost billions. And we keep doing it. We’re getting better at it. We never get over it. There are two types of mistakes: 1) doing nothing, what Warren calls “sucking my thumb” and 2) buying with an eyedropper things we should be buying a lot of.” #9 “With tech — and you see this with a lot of these new entrepreneurs — they’re 25, 30, 35 years old, and they’re working to the limit of their physical capability. And from the outside, these companies look like they’re huge successes. On the inside, when you’re running one of these things, it always feels like you’re on the verge of failure; it always feels like it’s so close to slipping away. And people are quitting and competitors are attacking and the press is writing all these nasty articles about you, and you’re kind of on the ragged edge all the time…“ “The life of any startup can be divided into two parts — before product/market fit (BPMF) and after product/market fit. When you are BPMF, focus obsessively on getting to product/market fit. Do whatever is required to get to product/market fit. Including changing out people, rewriting your product, moving into a different market, telling customers no when you don’t want to, telling customers yes when you don’t want to, raising that fourth round of highly dilutive venture capital — whatever is required.” Starting a business isn’t easy or for the faint of heart. At the same time there is not business that is easy. Almost every company is less attractive when viewed from the inside than it appears from the outside. My friend Craig McCaw said to me more than once that a ship as viewed from the dock may look pretty with the captain smiling from the upper deck in a resplendent uniform — but under the decks there is inevitably some ugliness associated with the travails of actually running something. The goal isn’t to be perfect but rather to be a great success. Working for a startup is something that some people might want to put on a personal bucket list. The reality is that is an amazing life experience, but it is not for everyone. Lots of people talk a good game about wanting to leave a company like Apple for a startup, but when the time comes most don’t actually do it. As an aside, Marc Andreessen does not buy into the conventional notion among many in Silicon Valley that failure is good. Some failures may be inevitable when you venture out as an entrepreneur or when you take a job in a startup and you may learn from that failure, but in his view the failure itself isn’t good. #10 “There’s a new generation of entrepreneurs in the Valley who have arrived since 2000, after the dotcom bust. They’re completely fearless.”… “Founders today are very technical, very product centric, and they are building great technology and they just don’t have a clue about sales and marketing…it’s almost like they have an aversion to learning about it.” “Many entrepreneurs who build great products simply don’t have a good distribution strategy. Even worse is when they insist that they don’t need one, or call no distribution strategy a ‘viral marketing strategy’ … a16z is a sucker for people who have sales and marketing figured out.” Marc Andreessen believes that a major problem with the 1999-200 bubble was that too many companies were driven by sales and marketing people who forgot or failed to appreciate that the business needed to have the ability to continually innovate. Having said that, these sales, marketing and distribution activities are essential to company success. Finding the right balance between is what great CEOs do well. Just hoping that an offering will go viral is not going to lead a company to success since something going viral is rarely an accident. Acquiring customers cost effectively is the essence of business. Almost always the best way to acquire customers cost effectively is with an organic customer acquisition strategy. In contrast, formulating a strategy based on buying advertising is unlikely to be successful. My previous post on marketing, distribution and sales goes into detail on this point. #11 “You spend most of your time actually dealing with your companies who are struggling and trying to help them. Because it’s the companies that are struggling or failing that actually need the most help. The companies that are succeeding are generally doing just fine without you. The companies that are failing are really the ones that need help and support. And so a lot of what you end up doing at the job is supporting struggling entrepreneurs. It’s kind of continuously humbling. You are a trouble shooter. There’s always something going wrong. Psychologically — we talk about this with our partners–you have to be psychologically prepared for the opposite. It seems like it’s going to be a life of glamor and excitement. It’s more of a life of struggle and misery. And if you are okay with that–because it’s part of the package — then the overall deal is pretty good.” Bill Gurley likes to say that venture capital “is a service business”. Venture capital isn’t sitting in expensive chairs “picking winners” and speaking at conferences, but rather day in and day out work in the trenches helping entrepreneurs succeed. An effective VC spends time on things like trying to recruit engineers for portfolio companies. This is not glamorous work for a venture capitalist, but it is essential work. #12 “Software is eating the world.” “Everybody’s going to have a computer. Everybody’s going to be on the Internet. And that’s a new world. That’s a world that we’ve never lived in before. We have no idea what that world is going to look like. It’s brand new. One of the things that you know is that all of a sudden, if you can conceive of a way to make a product or a service, and if you can conceive of a way to deliver it, through software, you can now actually do that.” “When you apply software you can do it in a very cost effective way… we now for the first time can basically go field by field, category by category, industry by industry, product by product, and we can say, ‘what would they be like if they were all software.’” The ‘software is eating the world’ thesis has always reminded me of what Bill Gates has said about why he refused to build hardware when Paul Allen suggested they should do so in the July 1994 issue of Playboy magazine: “When you have the microprocessor doubling in power every two years, in a sense you can think of computer power as almost free. So you ask, Why be in the business of making something that’s almost free? What is the scarce resource? What is it that limits being able to get value out of that infinite computing power? Software.” What is new today, and what Marc is talking about when he says ‘software is eating world’, is that the hardware is already in place waiting for the software at global scale. There is no longer a requirement that a software company manufacture the hardware systems needed to implement that system. Smartphones are increasingly ubiquitous. Computers and storage can be bought on demand as needed. The power of software to enable change drives Marc’s infectious optimism: “This is sort of where I disagree so much with people who are worried about innovation slowing down, which is that I think the opposite is happening. I think innovation is accelerating. Because the minute you can take something that was not software and make it software, you can change it much faster in the future. It’s much easier to change software than it is to change something with a big, physical, real-world footprint.” Importantly, when this innovation-driven change happens people’s lives get better. That this improvement in people’s lives is not captured in statistics like GDP, because it is consumer surplus or hard to measure, is a problem with economics — not technology or business.

The full content has been reprinted below, with our own formatting. You can also listen to an a16z Podcast with Gil on the book (and other topics) here. It’s a thrilling thing to build a new product, then watch as consumers actually pick it up. But achieving product/market fit also marks the beginning of a challenging time for a lot of founders. You’ve poured your energy into getting here — now what? Few people have as much insight into this make-or-break moment as Marc Andreessen. As a repeat founder himself and one of Silicon Valley’s most influential investors, he’s seen firsthand that the decisions startups make at this juncture are some of the most consequential they will ever make. I spoke with Marc to get his top recommendations for how startup leaders can turn early success into lasting relevance. Elad: After you’ve achieved product/market fit, what do you think are the most important determinants of a company’s success? You have your first product working, everything is scaling, everything seems to be going great, but now it’s time for you to do these three things. What are those things in your mind, or what are the most common issues people run into? Marc: I think there are three big categories. Once there’s product/market fit, then the main thing becomes taking the market — which is to say, figuring out how to get the product to the entire market, how to get dominant market share; because most tech markets tend to end up with one company with most of the market share. And that company tends to be all the value that gets created in that sector, from a return standpoint. That company also tends to have all the resources to do everything else that they want to do, including build new products. So winning the market is the big thing. The thing that is so essential that people need to understand is that the world is a really big place. The good news is that markets are bigger than ever. There are more consumers on the internet than ever before. There are more businesses that use software than ever before. There are more sectors of the economy where this stuff all matters. And so the markets are bigger than before. But that means that the challenge of building an organization, a model, and a distribution capability that can actually get the product to all the customers is an intense challenge. And of course the personality type of the technical founder who creates a breakthrough product, they don’t necessarily intuitively understand that that next part involves taking down the market. That’s number one. Number two is getting to the next product. We are in a product cycle business. Which is to say that every product in tech becomes obsolete, and they become obsolete pretty quickly. If all you do is take your current product to market and win the market, and you don’t do anything else — if you don’t keep innovating — your product will go stale. And somebody will come out with a better product and displace you. So you do need to get to the next product. Of course that’s a punishingly hard thing to do. It was hard enough to get to the first one, and to come up with the second one is often even harder. Although the consistency between these two tasks is this: If you do take the market, you tend to have the financial resources to be able to invest heavily in R&D. And you also develop M&A currency, so you can then go buy the second product if you have to. It gives you another option to get to the second product. Elad: And that can also use your established distribution that you can just plug into, which is nice. Marc: Exactly. In fact, the general model for successful tech companies, contrary to myth and legend, is that they become distribution-centric rather than product-centric. They become a distribution channel, so they can get to the world. And then they put many new products through that distribution channel. One of the things that’s most frustrating for a startup is that it will sometimes have a better product but get beaten by a company that has a better distribution channel. In the history of the tech industry, that’s actually been a more common pattern. That has led to the rise of these giant companies over the last fifty, sixty, seventy years, like IBM, Microsoft, Cisco, and many others. The general model for successful tech companies, contrary to myth and legend, is that they become distribution-centric rather than product-centric. They become a distribution channel, so they can get to the world. But then the third thing you need to do is what I call “everything else,” which is building the company around the product and the distribution engine. That means becoming competent at finance, HR, legal, marketing, PR, investor relations, and recruiting. That’s the stuff that’s the easiest to put to one side — for a little while. If you’ve got a killer product and a great sales engine, you can put that other stuff aside for a while. But the longer you put that stuff aside, the more risk that you develop and the more you expose yourself to catastrophic failure through self-inflicted wounds. Of course, the obvious one that we’re all seeing right now in this environment is HR. The number of companies in the Valley that put HR off to the side and decided it wasn’t important and are now dealing with some level of catastrophe — either a public catastrophe or one that’s in the making — that’s a pretty high percentage of companies right now. And it’s totally unnecessary. If they had taken HR seriously starting at an earlier point, they probably would have been able to fight a lot of their issues. But for whatever reason they decided it wasn’t important. So HR has to be taken seriously. Then there’s legal. We see cases in the Valley where companies have just decided that laws are optional, felonies are fine. And at some point, not having a general counsel who’s able to explain to the CEO where the line is, that becomes a big issue. And obviously finance. There are companies that blow themselves up financially that don’t have to, with wildly out-of-control cost structures or horribly screwed-up pricing or whatever. Elad: A common question for a lot of founders, especially first-time founders, is when should they actually hire an HR leader or somebody in the HR function or a GC [general counsel] or somebody for finance? Is that at a certain round of financing? Is it at a certain revenue level? Is it at a certain number of people? When should you start adding those different functions? Marc: It’s somewhere between 50 to 150 people. It’s somewhere in there. If you don’t start layering in HR once you’ve passed 50 people on your way to 150, something is going to go badly wrong. I think there’s actually an explanation for that. It’s because 150 is the Dunbar number, the number of people you can directly know. So somewhere between 50 to 150 people, everybody doesn’t know everybody. There are people running around who other people have never met. When you were 5 or 10 or 20 people, it was one big happy family and everybody knew everybody — well, maybe it wasn’t, but at least everybody knew everybody. And the CEO had direct one-on-one relationships with everybody in the company. Once you get to 50+, that’s just no longer the case. At that point there’s a necessary impersonality of the professional relationships in the company. And then HR catastrophes emerge, because people trip the line from proper professional behavior in a workplace to improper. There are just too many people running around interacting. Elad: Let’s focus on each of these three points. When it comes to taking down the market, can you talk a little bit more about the primary things that people should be doing? And what do people tend to miss, or where do they tend to screw things up? Marc: I think the single biggest thing is that every market has early adopters. There are early adopters for everything, and it’s kind of amazing that that’s the case. But there are always people. There are people on product sites every day looking for the next new consumer thing to try. There are even early adopter CIOs. There are Fortune 500 CIOs who pride themselves on discovering the next new whatever it is — the new relational database, AI, whatever it is. They’re all over it. And a lot of product/market fit is the fit with the early adopters. And so you get these extremely enthusiastic people, who in a lot of cases have sought you out as the vendor, saying, “Wow, your thing is really cool. Can I please use it?” And that’s your sign of product/market fit. The problem is, the early adopters are only ever a small percentage of the overall market. And so a lot of founders, especially technical ones, will convince themselves that the rest of the market behaves like the early adopters, which is to say that the customers will find them. And that’s just not true. In the consumer world, it’s not true because people have plenty of existing things they can spend their time on. They have to be convinced to try the next new thing. And so whether you want to call that marketing or growth hacking or user acquisition or whatever you want to call it, there’s some distribution function there, for all these things, that’s critical. And then for sure for B2B. Most businesspeople in the world, most CIOs or whoever is going to buy technology in a business, don’t wake up in the morning and say, “Gee whiz, can I go find the next hot thing to take a chance on?” That’s not how businesspeople live their lives. And so there needs to be some distribution capability to get to them. Again, the danger there is a market share thing. If you stick to the early adopters, you’ll get 5% of the market, but you’re not going to get 95% of the market. And that means, sort of by definition, somebody else is going to go get 95%. One of the things you see crystal clearly in VC is how much competition emerges whenever anything works. Every single time we say, “Oh, this startup is unique. There’s some unique product here and there’s not going to be competition,” invariably six months later there are 20 venture-backed competitors doing the exact same thing. And so at some point, if the early  guys don’t get to the other 95% of the market, somebody else is going to go take it away. And whoever has 95% of the market, number one they’re going to get all the value. All the investment returns, all the employee compensation flows to that company. And then number two, that company then accretes resources so they can work backward. In a lot of cases, they end up buying the company that got the early adopters for a small percentage of their equity, and then they just take the whole thing. Elad: You mentioned three or four tactical things that startups can do to stay viable. One is product iteration and building products that serve more of that market. Second, you really emphasize building up distribution. Third is M&A, which seems to be really underutilized in Silicon Valley today, at least in terms of the next generation of companies. If you have a $10 or $20 billion market cap, you should be buying things. One thing you didn’t mention, but I’d love to hear more on, is moats — in other words, building defensibility into what you’re doing. As you think about those four different factors, how do you rank them or think about common failure modes? Marc: I am shocked by the absence of M&A relative to what I would expect in the environment. And I would say there’s no question that the big new tech incumbents are not buying enough stuff just on the math. I think it’s just kind of obvious. In the old days, their predecessor companies were far more aggressive at building up their positions for M&A. And honestly, the Fortune 500, the big public companies, are not nearly as aggressive as I think they’re going to be I think this is a temporary lull. I think five years from now we’re going to be having a very different conversation, because it’s just going to become obvious that this is an underutilized thing. And I do think that that could be a very effective weapon, therefore, for somebody who really figures this out and does it aggressively in the right way. Cisco is one of the great case studies in the Valley. It’s a very successful, very big, very established company, and a very large percentage of that has been M&A. And then obviously Google. Probably an under-told part of the Google story is how M&A built Google. People, I think, don’t even necessarily remember the number of things that Google bought that turned into what you think of today as Google-originated products. As far as defensibility, I think you construct defensibility through some combination of product innovation and distribution building. You construct it. You obviously want as much defensibility as you can get in your product, and so you try to get as far out ahead as you can. It’s the idealized Peter Thiel model of “build something nobody else can build.” Or the SpaceX model of “go get all the talent.” The problem with that is true defensibility purely at the product level is really rare in the Valley, because there are a lot of really good engineers. And there are new ones every day, whether they’re coming out of Stanford or coming in from other countries or whatever. And then there’s the issue of leap-frogging. The next team has the opportunity to learn from what you did and then build something better. So I think pure product defensibility is obviously highly desirable, but it’s actually quite difficult. I think the distribution moats end up being at least as important. At some point, whoever has the distribution engine and gets 100% of the market, at some point that engine itself is a moat. Again, that might be an enterprise sales team for a SaaS company, or it might be the growth team at a consumer company. One interesting question I have is: Would you rather have another two years’ lead on product, or a two years’ lead on having a state-of-the-art growth effort? I think the answer for a lot of consumer products is actually that you’d rather have the growth effort. The other big missing variable in all of this is pricing. I’ve talked in public about this before. What I don’t hear from companies is, “Oh, we don’t think we have a moat.” What I hear from companies is, “Oh, we have an awesome moat, and we’re still going to price our product cheap, because we think that’s somehow going to maximize our business.” I’m always urging founders to raise prices, raise prices, raise prices. First of all, raising prices is a great way to flesh out whether you actually do have a moat. If you do have a moat, the customers will still buy, because they have to. The definition of a moat is the ability to charge more. And so number one, it’s just a good way to flesh out that topic and really expose it to sunlight. Raising prices is a great way to flesh out whether you actually do have a moat… The definition of a moat is the ability to charge more. And then number two, companies that charge more can better fund both their distribution efforts and their ongoing R&D efforts. Charging more is a key lever to be able to grow. And the companies that charge more therefore tend to grow faster. That’s counterintuitive to a lot of engineers. A lot of engineers think there’s a one-dimensional relationship between price and value. They have this mental model of commerce like they’re selling rice or something. It’s like, “My product is magical and nobody can replicate it, and I need to price it like it’s a commodity.” No, you don’t. In fact, quite the opposite. If you price it high, then you can fund a much more expensive sales and marketing effort, which means you’re much more likely to win the market, which means you’re much more likely to be able afford to do all the R&D and acquisitions you’re going to want to do. And so we always try to snap people into a two-dimensional mindset, where higher prices equals faster growth. Elad: That’s an awesome insight. I feel like there’s two really key notes that you brought up that typically aren’t talked about. One is distribution moats. I think people emphasize network effects and data effects way too much, and I’ve never seen a real data effect, at least recently. And then second is charging more equals faster growth. Those are really key things that people really don’t talk about or think about. Marc: I think network effects are great, but in a sense they’re a little overrated. The problem with network effects is they unwind just as fast. And so they’re great while they last, but when they reverse, they reverse viciously. Go ask the MySpace guys how their network effect is going. Network effects can create a very strong position, for obvious reasons. But in another sense, it’s a very weak position to be in. Because if it cracks, you just unravel. I always worry when a company thinks the answer is just network effects. How durable are they? The problem with network effects is they unwind just as fast. And so they’re great while they last, but when they reverse, they reverse viciously. To your point on data network effects, I would just say that we don’t see it very often. We see a lot of claims, and very little evidence. The reality is, there’s a lot of data in the world, and a lot of ways to get data. We have not seen very many data moats that actually make sense, even in science. Deep learning is the latest area where people think there’s data network effects. The problem is there’s innovation in deep learning to actually do deep learning on small data sets now. So even the science strains underneath that in a way that’s undermining it. So that’s risky. Elad: I’d love to talk a little bit about getting the next product in the product cycle. How do you start iterating and how do you come up with your v2 or your new product area? And how do you think about percent investment in core adjacent versus completely new areas? Google had a 70-20-10 framework. Do you think frameworks like that work? Marc: I don’t really like the numeric version of the answer because it’s kind of what big, dumb companies do. They say, well, we invest R&D as a percentage. But anybody who’s actually worked in R&D knows it’s not really a question of money. It’s not really a question of percentage of spend. It’s who’s doing it. What I’ve always found is this: give me a great product picker and a great architect, and I’ll give you a great product. But if I don’t have a great product manager, a great product originator — it used to be called a product picker — and I don’t have a great architect, I’m not going to get a great product. Elad: Google’s framework, by the way, was percentage of people. So it was 70% of human resources versus financial. But fair enough. Marc: But it’s kind of the same thing. I mean, it’s a fine concept, but it begs the question: Who are the people? I would take more of a micro-view of it. Which is: Okay, how many great product pickers do you have, people who can actually conceptualize new products? And then how many great architects do you have, who can actually build it? Sometimes, by the way, those are the same person. Sometimes it’s a solo act. And sometimes that’s the founder. As you scale, you need more of those people. But I always think it’s a matter of, okay, how many of those people do you have or can you go get? Or, back to acquisition, how many of those can you acquire? And then basically that’s the number of products you can be working on. You organize R&D around that, in my view. You want to have a relatively flat R&D structure. You basically want to have autonomous teams, where each team is guaranteed to have a great product person and a great architect. And that’s the model. This is why I always ask people, okay, let’s just do an inventory of how many of those people you think you have. And even at really, really big companies, it’s not a large number. Even at giant companies there might be ten or twenty of each, maybe. And then you build the rest of the engineering organization around those people, including all the rest of the stuff that you do for recruiting and onboarding and all that other stuff. But at the core of it, who do you actually have who can conceptualize new products, and who do you actually have who can build it? If it’s the founder, fair enough. But you need to construct the organization so that the founder has the time to continue to do that. So that gets to all the questions around when you need an outside CEO or when you need a COO. And then, even the founders who can do that themselves eventually run out of time. And the challenges get bigger. So how do they attract and retain people who can pick up some of that work for them? Elad: If it does get distributed, do you have any perspective on whether it should be a general management, verticalized structure versus a matrixed one? Marc: I generally think matrixed is death, so I’m always pushing companies to go to a flat structure of independent teams. I’m really on the Jeff Bezos program on that, the two-pizza team thing [Jeff Bezos favors product innovation teams with five to seven people — no more than can be fed with two pizzas]. I think hierarchies kill innovation for the most part. And I think that matrixes are just lethal in most cases. There are exceptions, but in most cases, you need original thinking and speed of execution, and it’s really hard to get that in anything other than a small-team format, in my view."}
{"text":"Editor’s note: This recent podcast interview of Marc Andreessen was conducted by Brian Koppelman, writer (Rounders, Ocean’s Thirteen, etc.), director, and showrunner (with David Levien) of Billions. The full Q&A is transcribed below, but you can also listen to this episode of “The Moment with Brian Koppelman” here. Brian: Hey, this is “The Moment.” I’m Brian Koppelman. Thanks for listening. I’m sitting here — my guest today is the brilliant Marc Andreessen — if you’re using the internet, you pretty much have him to thank; Marc invented Mosaic and Netscape, and is also among the leading VCs in the world at his company, Andreessen Horowitz. And someone I’ve become, I’ve been lucky enough to become quite friendly with over the last few years, and has been very helpful behind the scenes with “Billions”. So, Marc Andreessen, thanks for being here. Brian: “Here”, being your office, by the way! Thanks for being in your office, on a Saturday, to talk to me. So, I was just with a bunch of VCs over the last few days, and the highest-thinking compliment that I saw people give was that somebody was an abstract thinker, that they understood systems. And that’s something they said about you in The New Yorker article that was written about you. Can you talk a little bit about what it means to be a systems thinker? Marc: Yah, so maybe let’s try to make it…start with concrete, and maybe make that concept itself more abstract. Brian: That’d be great. Marc: So just think about it through the lens of a new tech product, which is kind of the center of what we do. Which is, if you’re not a systems thinker, basically you say, I’m gonna build a really great product, right? And then it’s, I’m gonna have a really great product, and then it’s gonna be great, because it’s a really great product. Right? You know, the systems thinking mode is like, hey, that’s just the first step — because it’s not just about the product. It’s about, okay, now, the product is going to enter into the marketplace, right? And then there are going to be customers that are gonna have a point of view on your product. And there are gonna be competitors that are gonna be trying to take you out with a better product. And there are going to be, you know, retail…you put your product in retail, and the retailers are gonna try to gouge you on price and make your product uneconomic to manufacture. And the press is going to write, you know, a review of your product, and maybe the reviewer’s gonna have a really bad day and he’s gonna say horrible things. And, you know, your employees are hard at work, they build the first product and you assume they’re gonna be there with you to build the second product. And maybe they will, maybe they won’t, because maybe somebody else will hire them. And so …basically with any kind of creative endeavor, anything that we do in our world — and this is, you know, for products or for companies — they’re launching into technically, what’s called a…there’s actually a mathematical term, “complex adaptive system”. The world is a complex adaptive system. And it’s sort of inherently…it’s not a predictable system. It’s not a linear system. It doesn’t behave in ways that you can expect. And that, by definition, so they say, is “complex” because it’s just, you know, many, many, many dimensions and variables, and then “adaptive”, like, it changes. Like, things change. The introduction of new product changes the system, and then the system recalibrates around the product. And so, as a consequence, like, you just…you have to launch a new type product and have it succeed. You have to have a keen awareness of all of the different elements of the system. You have to have a willingness to engage in the entire system. You know, it’s a gigantic problem generally if you’re in denial about that, right, if you’re not willing to think in systems terms, right? And so that’d be the starting point to at least understand what this means in our world. Brian: When do you think… So, for artists, because we’ve talked a lot about how there are many similarities between what people in your world do and people in my world do. When do you wanna let that stuff… I have two questions: One is how does someone train themselves to become a systems thinker. But two is, and I guess reverse it, that’s the second one. The first one is, when should a creator, an ideater, begin thinking of all of those potential impediments, or how to flip those impediments to a strength; and when should they be trying just to ideate? Marc: Right. So you may know, there’s actually been a lot of work done on actually analyzing the source and sort of causes and effects of creative achievement, creative success. There’s been a whole bunch of interesting sort of things that have come out of that, sort of a subfield of psychology and sociology. And there was just a study that just was on Twitter in the last week… The claim of the study was — and this is art as in like fine art; so it’s like painting as an example, of very pure version of art, let’s say — but even for like paintings, it’s creative achievement and creative success, creative success of creative work. Is it caused more by the quality of the work itself or by the social network of the artist? Brian: I saw that study. Marc: Is that right? The friends of the artist. And, what you find is a lot of pure creatives will, will think about that question and they’ll find it offensive. Because the whole point of being a creative, a creator, is I have a vision and I create. And it’s sort of a, you know, it just seems kind of self-evident: Obviously, the world is going to appreciate what I create (like, you know, if it’s a sufficient quality level)… Like, if the world does not appreciate it, it’s the world’s fault. The more pragmatic view is that art — even just pure art — art is in the mind of both the creator and the viewer. What is the creative value of a painting if nobody sees it? Or, if when people see it, they don’t like it. And so the pure creative would like to believe that’s the viewer’s fault, right?, that’s the audience’s fault. And you know people like this– Brian: Or the timing is wrong. Marc: Well, timing is a gigantic “complexifier”, to use Jeff Bezos’ new favorite word. Marc: Timing is a giant X-factor — and we should talk about timing, because that’s a giant X-factor in the way these systems work — but fundamentally, … when I was a creator — in the form of when I was building software, or now that I’m more in the role of funding and supporting creators — I just view it as creativity is a collaborative exercise between the creator and the audience. The more pragmatic view is that art is in the mind of both the creator and the viewer. What is the creative value of a painting if nobody sees it? And I think that’s very natural, I think it’s a systems –, it’s a human system, right? And so therefore, it’s the responsibility in my view, it’s the responsibility of the artist to be willing to engage in that, and willing to be practical about that, and willing to think hard about that, and willing to do things required to get… work in front of people. And so, it’s easier for me to have an opinion about that for painters — and that’s not my field. and so I’m just…that’s just kind of random opinion — I will tell you in tech, this is a really big difference between success and failure. Right? For what we do. For an entrepreneur who expects the market to just automatically appreciate the product — it’s the classic, if I build a better mousetrap the world will beat a path to my door, is the old cliché — it’s like, well, no, they won’t! Like, the world is busy. People already have stuff going on. <Right!> People don’t wake up in the morning and say, “God, I can’t wait until I find out what this person I’ve never heard of in California has invented. Like, that’s not how the world works — you have to inject yourself into the world. And so in our world, the successful people are the ones who are able to do the creating and are able to then kind of push into the world — Steve Jobs put a ding in the universe — the people who are actually willing to carry the idea forward, and proselytize it, and evangelize it, and argue it, and advocate for it, and make sure people see it, and make sure it succeeds. The world is busy. You have to inject yourself into the world! Brian: And so either you have to be able to do that or you have to find somebody who could do it with you or for you. Irving Azoff for Don Henley and Glenn Frey or Albert Grossman for Dylan, although Dylan’s a complicated question — But when you look at… So when artists… like, when Hemingway would mythologize, you know, if you read “A Moveable Feast,” I guess he was in the salon with all these people but who then recognized… Marc: He was in the middle of a network. Brian: He was in the middle of a network, though he wouldn’t have thought of it that way, probably. So, do you think that some people are just instinctively do that as part of their art,  is the broadcasting of their art? Marc: So, Brian Eno has a term, you may have heard, called “scenius”, have you heard this term? Brian: No, but I love Eno’s work. Marc: Okay. So Brian Eno has this term called sceners. Kevin Kelly and Stewart Brand and others have talked about this at length and I think it’s right, which is, it’s this… Let’s start with it is it’s an amazing coincidence. It’s an amazing coincidence how when there’s a major new artistic movement, it’s an amazing how there’s a scene. There’s quite literally a scene. And so Hemingway was part of a scene… There’s an example — Brian: Patti Smith’s book talks about this, right? “Just Kids” talks about it in a great way, being in New York at that time. Marc: I mean, one great example, you know, I’ve spent a lot of time with our friend Michael Ovitz over the years understanding kind of how this has worked and how creativity works in entertainment, and he says, basically, he says 100% of the time it’s a scene. So for example, he cites the great scene in comedy, when he was coming up was “Saturday Night Live”, you know, The Second City/ Saturday Night Live phenomenon in the mid 70s. And it was it was this, you know, Saturday Night Live shows up on TV in, you know, 1975 and people are like, Oh my… you know, this is like a brand new thing. Like, where did this come from? And it turns out, it was all these people. It was, you know, Chevy Chase, and Gilda Radner, and Bill Murray, and, you know, John Belushi, and all these… Lorne Michaels — Brian: And the Canadians, the SCTV scene — Marc: Yes, the Canadians, the SCTV scene, exactly right. And like, they all knew each other; they all knew each other coming up. And basically you find this — like, comedy is actually a great example of this, you just see this — inevitably, like, there was the Judd Apatow scene, like, there was a set of those people; there’s like the Seth Rogen, you know, kind of they’re at the center of these networks. And then these people then spin off and they do their own work and they became become very successful. Um you know, most recently like the Tina Fey, Amy Poehler kind of thing was a scene. <Brian: Sure. Absolutely.> Upright Citizens Brigade [Theater] and Second City. And so, it’s this… these are clearly creative geniuses on their own, but like, they weren’t out in the wilderness somewhere. Brian: Well, what I took from the article — I didn’t read the study but I saw the Times article about it — was that artists will recognize other… Part of what happens, this amplifying effect is that, if you’re good… if you’re really good at this stuff, don’t necessarily think about people, always think about the buyer. People are always like, “How can I get an agent? How can I get a buyer?” As opposed to, “How can I show my work to other artists who can help platform it?” And that’s what I took from that article was that, there are, that in fact, … The best way to get an agent is to have some artist who thinks you’re great, who’s represented by that agent, tell that agent, right? Do you think systems thinking — because like, if you look at Dylan as an example, just to try to put it in my world a bit, right — he did come here, come to New York and then enter and take over this scene that existed. Do you think someone has to calculate that stuff… or do you think there are people who just naturally do it? Marc: So I think it’s a complex adaptive system. It has feedback loops, what are called feedback loops. You know, and some people get in the position of the feedback loop starts to hit. It’s almost a little bit… feedback loops are funny things… There’s this concept in economics actually derived from something out of the Christian Bible called the Matthew Effect, right? It’s sort of like, in a lot of these fields, recognition begets recognition, success begets success, reputation begets reputation, right? So it’s a positive feedback loop. And you see this when kind of people are on the rise in their careers, right? Brian: I was with people from Twitter the other day and they were talking about this too, about one of the challenges at Twitter in terms of growing it, right, is that the people who are verified and have a good following are able to very quickly make their following bigger. <Marc: Yah> But for someone who’s just starting, it’s really hard now to amass an audience. Marc: Just like, by the way, it’s very hard to become a new recognized painter, it’s very hard to write a screenplay that gets made, right? It’s a… these are so-called nonlinear dynamical systems, technically, and they have these feedback loops. And a lot of this goes back to kind of the human attitude of the people involved in doing the work, it’s like, there’s two ways to look at that. One is, oh my god, life isn’t fair. And like, this is just fundamentally, you know, horrible. And we should figure out a way to, like, reform these systems so there’s a much more equal distribution of, you know, returns and results. Another way to look at it is, it os the human system, it is humanity, it is how… we are social animals, we do care what other people think. To your point, we care what the other experts think. We do care what our friends think. And we respond to those things. And part of what makes a creative project valuable is the fact that people appreciate it. And, just the nature of it is people are gonna tend to appreciate the things that other people are appreciating. And so it is what it is, and therefore, if you’re going to be a creative professional, you should lean into that you should. You should take that seriously and you should consider that part of the challenge. Because I think that… the alternate path is bitterness. And we see this in the Valley, one of these billion programmers. They’ve been working for 10 years on some project and like they’ve got the code running. It’s all working and like nobody — you know, it’s not out there, nobody appreciates it, it’s sitting on a shelf in a lab somewhere — and they’re just furious, right? And it’s like, “Well, what have you done to try to inject this into the world?” “Well, nothing.” “Why not?” “Well, because my work is genius and people should appreciate it. And it’s their fault if they don’t.” As an individual, that will poison you, right?, <Yes!> that will destroy you. And so that’s… why you have to be really careful in these things whether you’re talking about society or whether you’re talking about the individual. Because from a societal standpoint, you can level all kinds of accusations about unfairness. From an individual level, you really want, in my view… individually, you wanna think, “I can do this. I can go change the world. I can go affect things.” It’s going it be real — Brian: And you’re saying, you shouldn’t just rely on the fact that your work alone privately will do it, you should be proactive in trying to get it out there. Marc: And part of it is you should get into a scene. So this is part of it. By the way, this also goes to another kind of view of unfairness right now which is like, okay, why do all the great movies and TV shows get made… why do the vast majority get made in LA.? Like, that’s so unfair to people. There are people who, like, try to make movies in San Francisco, and they’ll tell you like, “It’s so unfair. Like, it’s just so much easier to do this in LA. Like, it should be easy to do this…” We get this in the startup world, like, why are a disproportionate number of startups built in Silicon Valley? Isn’t it unfair that you don’t have equal odds of doing this if you’re in Topeka? Well, that’s one way of looking at it. The other way of looking at it is, if I’m the indiv– you know, I grew up in rural Wisconsin — like, if the job is to get enmeshed into the system, right, into the network, then basically, what you wanna do as an individual is you wanna get yourself into the scene. Brian: Yah Tony Hsieh calls them “collision spaces”. Marc: Yeah. You gotta get in the mix, right. And if you’re not willing to get in the mix, it’s not their fault. It’s your fault, right? Again, as an individual, that’s the — Brian: Because we’re talking about is people who… what did… other than Van Gogh get to paint those paintings and feel that feeling, but his inability to talk to people — the work ultimately, it did him some good, but not nearly the good it could have done him, right? …Emily Dickinson, the same thing. Marc: Yeah. Look, I’m completely open to the idea that there’s an alternate-universe Brian Koppelman, let’s call him “Krian Boppelman” <Yes!>, who’s a machinist in Albany, New York, who’s got a whole bunch of genius screenplays on the shelf. And, you know, someday he’s gonna die and his kids are goona discover and publish them and we’ll be like, “Oh my god. Look at all these great TV shows that never got made.” Because the world wasn’t enlightened enough to be able to go seek him out. I’m open to the possibility that that person exists… [but] I don’t know what to do with that? Brian: Right, right. So you gotta find — what you’re saying that you have to find a way to present yourself… But the challenge is, as you know, oftentimes, the approach that people make has the opposite effect of what they hope, right, when they have a product. Someone has an idea and they see you in a mall and they come– right? So that’s another piece of it, is how do you manage that. Marc: Ahh… So that’s the other thing. So there’s a great — in our world, there was a great Dilbert strip where the pony-haired boss says, “You know, I have a great idea for a startup. All I need is for, you know, somebody to actually, like, write the code and do all the work.” And Dilbert says, “The technical term for what you have is, ‘nothing’” <laughs> … right? Right? And so this is the other side — at least in my world, I suspect in your world — but at least in my world, you actually see this a lot. You’ll see people say, like, “I have an idea, but it’s such a good idea, I can’t tell anybody about it, because they’ll steal my idea”. And at least in our world, like, literally it is, therefore, what you now have is nothing… There’s another great — I forget who said it, there’s another great line somebody said that — “If you have a really, really great idea, like, you can shout it to the rafters and like, still nobody’s gonna take it seriously.” Like, the world is filled with ideas. Like, there is actually no idea shortage. And in fact, by the way, many people actually have the same ideas. And by the way, many of the ideas are actually reasonably obvious. Like, you know, the iPhone. We’re all carrying around these… Like, what a genius idea was the iPhone. Well, hey, how about a computer you can hold in your hand. Like, how about a computer that you don’t have to carry in a briefcase, you can hold in your hand. Brian: I mean, between William Gibson and… I mean, everybody’s had the… Marc: “Star Trek,” freakin “Star Trek”! They had them on “Star Trek” in 1966. Like, yeah, I want a computer I can hold in my hand. Like, the idea alone didn’t get Steve Jobs anywhere. It was everything else that he did to make the idea a reality — and actually get it into people’s hands — that mattered. And…by the way, we get this all the time, you get pitched, you know, I’m a founder with an idea, it doesn’t mean anything; like, you know, we’ve got an unlimited number of those. We can generate as many of those as we want. Brian: But I guess what I’m asking is, how do you learn to — Do you think one can learn to do both things? To be a creator, founder/creator, and the salesman of your own work? Like, how does one learn to do that? Marc: Yes. Well, so first of all… put it this way — this is, again, where I think systems thinking is actually helpful — ao, actually, we have a lot of this, so we have a lot of sort of founders who are like classical engineers, and they’re sort of classical introverts and the idea of having to go, kind of, you know, sell is like anathema, like, the idea. You know, they’ve got these kind of, I would say, misperceptions of the salesman as somebody who’s wearing a shiny suit <Brian: Yes, perfect!> selling somebody something that they don’t need. And so, we have a couple of responses to that. We have a specific response to that, which is actually the role of sales is (at least in our industry) is not to sell something you don’t need — it’s actually to help somebody buy what they actually do need. And we can have a long conversation about that. The really good sales people in Silicon Valley who make a lot of money become very personally bonded to their customers; they end up going to their customers’, you know, weddings, to their kids’ weddings — like, they become like, very close allies to the careers of their customers. We can have a long conversation about that. It’s a real form of value-add to the customer. The role of sales is not to sell something they don’t need — it’s actually to help somebody buy what they actually do need. But even deeper than that. The thing I tell the engineers is, look, dealing with customers, it’s another systems problem. Like, you are the master of solving a systems problem, which is how to get the computer to do what you want. Like, people aren’t computers, they’re different, but there is a system for dealing people. You can engineer a system for dealing with people. And actually, when you work with top-end sales people, what you find is they have incredibly elaborate, like, very real systems. Like, very, very, very thought-through kind of abstract systems of how they basically run like, a large-scale sales campaign and how they deal with the customer. So for example, there’s a process in sales for qualification which is you’re basically trying to gauge like, is the customer ever going to buy? — Marc: Can they buy. And that’s a very, there’s actually orchestrated multi-step processes, there’s entire software packages that get sold just to be able to track and manage that process. And so I always tell engineers, actually, put your engineer hat on and think about it as an engineering problem, and you’ll be able to figure it out. And by the way, it’s not as hard as building an operating system… Like, you can figure this stuff out. Now, you have to want to. Brian: No, you have to want to. But it’s because the typical approach both to you and to me is, hey, will you read my screenplay; my screenplay is really good — but in fact, you said something brilliant when you pointed us to that piece about artists talking to artists because I won’t read anything that anybody sends me randomly, right? when someone contacts me online — “Please read my screenplay” it’s like, no, but… Brian: Well, for a variety of reasons. One, there’s nothing that’s enticed me to read it that makes it seem– they haven’t enticed me by who they are yet, right? Now, if they’re on Twitter and I’m on Twitter, and somebody I know has put them in my life, and they have some sort of credibility because of some kind of social proof, then that might get me to have a conversation where I guide them into what they could do to put themselves in a position that someone will read their stuff. But, if one of my writer friends, or a producer friend, or an agent says, “Uh, you gotta check this thing out, here’s the reasons why” — I’m immediately gonna check it out. Because it’s become elevated to a place that it’s worth engaging with. <Marc: Right> Also I don’t wanna get sued. I don’t wanna get sued. That’s the other thing. I can’t read stuff because you read stuff and you get sued. I mean, that’s– Marc: If you were to have that same idea in some project later on down the road– Brian: Someone could just sue you and there’s nothing that you can do about it. So you do think this all can be taught, which is that’s encouraging. Marc: You have to want to learn how to do it. And then at some point, look, you do have to have, at some point, you have to have the kind of personality. Like, if you’re gonna hate it, like, there are founders where they could actually totally understand the process of sales and they’re gonna be so introverted as an example, that they’re just gonna hate the interaction and they’re just gonna, you know, can’t wait until they stop talking to these people. In that case, then you start talking about building the team. Brian: How do you talk to people though who have that chip on their shoulder, like, they look at someone like Elon as like, “Well, hey, that guy’s just as a showman!” Do you know what I mean? Like, not him specifically, but they almost feel like it cheapens what they do; like… Marc: Oh, this is actually interesting. Elon actually used to tell us, it’s the Edison vs. Tesla thing. So actually, in Edison’s day — so, you know, Edison is credited for phonograph, indoor lighting, all this stuff; and then Tesla was this guy, had all these super genius, like, there’s this huge debate over AC vs DC electricity, and there’s an ultimate power grid that we could have that runs a DC that’s much better, and Tesla had that idea — and there’s this whole thing. And so there’s this kind of engineer archetype of like Edison was the showman, he was a mediocre engineer but he was the showman. And Tesla was the unappreciated genius. And it’s a perfect example of this. It’s like, okay, well, whose fault was that? Brian: Right. Right… you’re saying it was Tesla’s fault. Marc: Like, what kept Nikola Tesla from like — I mean, the stuff Edison did to go promote his stuff, like, it wasn’t that — it’s the same thing; it wasn’t that hard to figure out. There were lots of people in that era that wanted to finance, you know, as an example, Edison raised all this money. There were lots of people who wanted to finance electricity. I mean, talk about like a growth market. Brian: And you take this into account <Yup> in terms of who you’re gonna invest in. Marc: Yeah, for sure. Brian: Part of what you’re taking into account is the Messianic abilities that the person has, right? Marc: Absolutely. As I say, the world is busy. There are 7 billion people on planet Earth whose time is already fully allocated. Right? And so there has to be something about — now, the work has to speak for itself, we can talk more about that — but then, somebody has got to pick up the flag and carry it into the world and make… Brian: We’ll talk about the work needs to stand for itself. Marc: Well, there’s the other side of this which is, none of this is an excuse for having the work not be good, right? <Brian: Yes.> And so, the best, the line I use all the time, the book I always recommended is Steve Martin’s book, Born Standing Up — Brian: It’s a spectacular book. Marc: Which is one of the best books I’ve ever read. And it’s a thin little book, basically… So how did Steve Martin succeed in comedy (it’s a pretty interesting topic because he was a gigantic success first in standup, and then later in film and other things), and the thing is, it’s very straightforward. In the book he says, “Be so good, they can’t ignore you”. Right? Brian: I often say, when people complain to me on Twitter, I often say, “Well, this is unfair.” So this is where you and I have a lot of similarity, and it is one of the areas, which is: I say, It’s unfair. If you’re a woman of color wanting to make it as a screenwriter, it’s really hard; the deck is stacked against you because of who the buyers are. However, once it’s unfair, once we acknowledge that, all you can do is write an undeniable script. That’s the only thing you can do, is write something undeniable, that breaks through it — now, that’s unfair. Marc: Well, I would say that’s one thing you can do. The other thing you can do is you can get yourself into a scene. Brian: Sure. So find a scene. Yes… Marc: Those are the two things. Brian: And what I like about this is, and this is a new perspective on this podcast because… partially because of my own life experience, which Dave and I wrote this thing in a basement, as you know (as we just talked about on your podcast). But your idea — and I know you said it’s Brian Eno’s thought, but it is really, as you’re saying it to me, it is smart, it makes a lot of sense — that you should consciously get into a scene — Marc: Well another way to think about it is, would you rather be a big fish in a small pond, or a small fish in a big pond? And then the small fish has the best product anybody’s ever seen. That’s the formula. Brian: Have you read Just Kids, the Patti Smith book? Brian: Oh, you’d love it; it’s a great audio book. But Patti Smith comes to New York and meets Robert Mapplethorpe the first day that she’s in New York and then the two of them end up in the world that Warhol and those people were all in. <Yah> And they just lived at the Chelsea Hotel, and they bounced around with those people. Patti had to do the genius work… but then when she did, people were there to appreciate it. Marc: And by the way, you know, most people who are like in this… most people who love the art of what they do, want there to be more great art. And they want there to be more great artists. <Brian: Yes.> They wanna be the kind of person who’s able to go find other great artists and talk to the great artist. And then most people, by the way, you know, in the financing business, like, we are dying to finance the next great startup. Like, people talk about like venture capitalists; it’s you gotta run on these gauntlets to do it or like it’s so, you know, they fund all this…you know, we’re dying to fund the next Google. Like, we can’t wait. So just for god’s sake, figure out a way to build it and bring it to us. Please! Brian: Right. Though, to get to you, somebody has to be credibly recommended to you. Marc: Okay, so then this gets to a concept that I talked… So this goes directly what we’re talking about. So you described the process of getting you to read somebody’s screenplay. And basically it’s they have to be a referral. There should be some sort of warm referral. Brian: Either a referral, or the only other way is over a period of time, you’ve impressed me somehow yourself. Marc: Yeah, exactly right, independent of this specific thing that you’re trying to create. So, it’s sort of a very similar thing in venture, which is, I mean, there are certain people where it’s just like, the reputation precedes them, and they want to come in to pitch us, we’re gonna take the pitch. And some of those people, by the way, you discover on Twitter. Like, so that’s a real thing. But more generally, it’s a referral business. And I figured this out early on, when we were starting, I talked to friends of mine at one of the top firms in the industry that’s now a 50-year-old venture firm, one of these legendary firms and they said, in the entire history of the venture firm, they funded exactly one startup pitch that came in cold, right, over 50 years. Now, they funded like a thousand that came in warm and they funded one that came in cold. And so anyway, so that’s like, okay, well, again, isn’t that unfair? Like, okay. So that’s why I get into what I call the test, with a capital T, The Test. And The Test is basically, the test to get to us, to get into VC is can you get one warm introduction? Just one. And in our world, you know, your world is agents or whatever or other creatives — in our world it’s an angel investor, it’s a seed funder, it’s a professor, it’s a manager at one of the big existing tech companies, right? Brian: Someone you think is smart. Marc: Yeah, somebody I think is smart. Brian: And knows people. Marc: But there are thousands of those people out there who I will take that call for. Brian: Like, I could call you and tell you, but somebody… By the way, I won’t. Let me just say, clearly, I will not!! <laughs> But you have this world… Marc: You could. Somebody, like, if a director of — I don’t know, there’s like, 1,000 executives at Facebook; Facebook is like a 40,000-person company, it has like, 1,000 executives at Facebook in decision-making capacity — if any one of the thousand calls up and says, “I got this kid I think you should meet.” It’s like, “Yes, I’ll take that meeting.” So it’s like, and again, it’s just one, right? And so the test is, can you get one person to refer you, right? And it’s like, okay, like… think of the number of ways you could get one person to refer you, you could go get a job and you could go impress a manager and then that manager makes the call. Brian: That is an incredibly good test, by the way. Marc: And if you can’t pass the test, The Test, to get a warm inbound referral into a venture firm, then what that indicates is, you are gonna have a hell of a time as an entrepreneur. You are gonna hate being an entrepreneur because guess what you have to do, once you raise money. We’re the easy — I always say like, we’re the easy part of the process. Once you raise money from us is when the pain begins. And the pain is trying to get other people to say yes to you. The pain specifically is trying to get people to work for you. And they all have choices, right? And so you got to convince them to come work for instead of somebody else; to try to get a customer to buy a product, and the customers are overwhelmed with new products they could buy… and so to actually sell something to somebody. And then at some point, you’re gonna have to raise money again, right? And you raise money from new people each round. At some point you’re gonna have to go get somebody else to say yes. And so, if you can’t get a warm inbound to us, how are you possibly going to be able to function in the environment in which you’re now gonna be operating, where you’re gonna have to get all these other people to do stuff for you. And so that’s the thing. And so that’s why there basically, there are no — For all intents and purposes, again, I’m open to the idea that there’s the undiscovered genius out there. Brian: How many cold ones have you funded? Marc: Never. I mean, zero — Brian: Zero cold, from an elevator, from someone walking up to you — Because what you find…if you find yourself face to face, what you find is the reason that they can’t pass the test is because they have the chip on the shoulder. And I’m pro chips-on-shoulders. A lot– Brian: We both have a chip on our shoulder. Marc: Yes! There’s a giant advantage of a chip on the shoulder. But there’s a very dysfunctional version of the chip on the shoulder, which is: I should be appreciated. I should be appreciated for who I am. Brian: I shouldn’t have to stoop. Marc: I should not have to stoop to do this stuff, right? I shouldn’t have to get the warm introduction. Brian: But of course to sell in the world, you have to be willing to walk into a room… and do the thing. Marc: Raising venture — I always say this — is the beginning of the pain of having to deal with people… to do stuff for you. Brian: Makes total sense. But just in case people don’t know, who are listening to this podcast, you know, Marc, you didn’t come from wealth and you didn’t come — nobody like, sort of handed all this to you. And when I sort of glibly at the beginning of the podcast said, if you’re using the internet, it’s because of Marc, I mean, I’m not being hyperbolic, you invented the first available browser that allowed people to browse the internet. You invented Mosaic, and then you invented Netscape, which became the most widely used browser and everything that’s happened since. You came up with an interface that people could use to surf the internet. How did you find a way to get your — well, I guess first I wanna know, when did you start to realize that you thought differently than most of your peers? And like, you know what I mean? How do we know that we’re right or we’re delusional? What I’m interested in is: When you realized you saw the world differently, how did you stay sane about it? Marc: I mean the answer to the question is I went to work. Brian: What do you mean? Marc: So after college, I immediately got a job and I just… I’d worked all through high school and so I just I knew I wanted to have a job that makes money. So I sat down with the “U.S. News & World Report” — they used to do the print magazine where they ranked all the colleges, universities, they ranked all the degree programs in the country, and then they ranked the starting salaries for each level — and so I literally got to the page where it was like, uh, for people with bachelor’s degrees coming out of American universities (because I didn’t wanna stay in school longer than I had to), what was the salary range? Top salary on down for the degrees. And the top one was EE. And I was like, okay, EE. Sounds good. And then I went to the EE page. And I was like, ok, what are the top EE schools? And it was like MIT, Stanford. Well, those are obviously out of reach for people where I come from. Brian: You mean, you just decided that that was out of reach? Marc: Nobody where I come from goes to Stanford, MIT. Brian: You didn’t think you could? Marc: Of course not. No. No chance. Marc: No possibility whatsoever. And nobody ever has. And it’s not a possibility. And so #3 was University of Illinois, which I was like, oh, interesting. Like, I was in Wisconsin, and so Illinois, it’s actually, like, it’s across the border and it’s about six hours away; and it’s a state school, and so I’d have to pay out-of-state tuition, but it was, you know, much cheaper than, you know, the sort of, the full private schools. And I was like, it’s #3 in the country, right, for EE, and I was like, this is great. So I went and applied and they love out of state students, because they pay full load, right? So then I showed up and got a job. And the job I got was — and I was into coding — and so I got a job in a software lab and I just like absolutely loved it. It was my kind of first time I was getting like, actually paid to like write code and work on things. In the Physics Department at Illinois. And then that ultimately led to an internship at IBM, and then that ultimately led to a job at NCSA, which is the center where we did all the work on Mosaic. And, so, part, you know, there was a big — I don’t know, luck or timing or whatever component to it — which is like, it’s so happened that when I got to Illinois, there was this environment… with all this federal funding to be able to do, you know, we basically had the modern internet at Illinois. There were four universities in the U.S. that had gotten funded in the 80s to basically effectively build — there were super computer centers. Supercomputers cost $25 million, so there was that. And then they basically built what they called the NSFNET, which was basically the internet. And so it was Cornell, San Diego, Illinois, and Pittsburgh. They were actually — three of the four were state schools. And so we basically had on campus, we had actually the modern — we didn’t have the web yet, but we had like the modern internet. Like, we had high speed broadband, including even in some of the dorms. You know, there were supercomputers, there were all these graphical workstations, which at the time was a big deal. And so there was a part of that, it was a scene. It was a scene. Brian: Yeah, sure. It was a scene. Marc: It was a fertile environment with people who were interested in this and then there was some set of resources… Brian: Did you have the notion in your head that you were going to change the world? Marc: No, of course, not. Brian: You really didn’t? Brian: Your ambition — this is important for like, I think people who wanna do creative work — like, the sort of how grand can the thoughts be? Like, for real, were you trying to just solve a specific problem, or did you have a sense that if we do this work, we might actually be able to influence the world? Marc: So it was like — I didn’t have the vocabulary then, but I have it now — so it was a complex adaptive system problem. And it was as follows, which is because of all this federal funding for the supercomputer centers, we had a lot of the modern internet running at Illinois; the students could use, the faculty used it, the researchers used it. All my work there, it was in this environment. The assumption was, the assumption was that you would use it while you were there. And then when you leave, you would stop using it. Right? So you would be on email, it was literally the assumption was email at the time. You’d be on email– Brian: Oh, we’re on the university email, but you then you won’t have use for it even when you’re gone? Marc: Who would you email in the real world?! Like, it was an inconceivable concept, right? And so literally, you would graduate and you would go buy a PC in the store when you graduate or have a PC assigned to you in your job and it wouldn’t be hooked up to the internet, because, why would you hook up to the internet? Like, there was no point to it, right? So the overwhelming assumption was you’d use it here, and then you wouldn’t use it in the real world. And this was part of the cultural divide at the time between like, you know, it was part of the — you know, sort of the nerd culture, the academic culture, and then the quote-unquote “real world” And so there was just this massive, my favorite (Sonal who’s with us will appreciate it, as a former Wired editor, will appreciate) — so I was working on Mosaic, it was in the middle of the night working on Mosaic and I go to a little corner store, fight my way through the blizzard most nights in the plains of Illinois and go to the corner store to get something to eat at like 2:00 in the morning. And I’d check the newsstand, check it out, and there’s, you know, the first issue of Wired magazine, right? And so I’m like, “Oh, this is, you know, wow. This is like, finally somebody made a magazine for me.” Like, yeah, somebody made a magazine that takes like, computer seriously. Like, how about that as an idea for a magazine? Right? So it’s like 1992, ’93. It was ’93, I think ’93. Yeah, ’93. So I’m like, okay, great. I’ll buy it. And I’m like, okay, it’s pretty good. So I’d buy my food, I go back to my little office in the basement in the lab and I’m reading the magazine. It’s going on and on about interactive TV and the information superhighway and this and that, digital tsunami, and this and that, and the whole… the manifesto, the whole thing. Didn’t mention the internet. There was no mention of the internet in the magazine. Brian: It was all virtual reality then. Marc: Virtual reality and “The Lawnmower Man” and like… Brian: I remember the beginning of Wired. Marc: There was no internet. The internet did not even merit a mention. Brian: AOL was around in ’94, right? ’93? Marc: AOL was not connected to the internet. AOL was not connected to the internet. Brian: So, how did AOL work back then? Marc: It was entirely a self — it was the so-called walled garden. It was a self-contained environment. Brian: I mean, so you would get on the internet to reach… If I was at home and my modem, where was my modem dialing in to? Brian: Only their office, like, their servers? Marc: Yeah, yeah. Their servers, their content. Brian: And everything happened within that world? Marc: Within AOL, yeah. Brian: So even if we thought that was the internet, it wasn’t. Marc: Yeah. You didn’t have access. So you would not have thought it was the internet, because you would not have thought– Brian: What would I have thought? Marc: You would have thought you were on AOL. So AOL was an advanced version of what was called a bulletin board system. A BBS. Brian: Yes, it was a bulletin board, that’s right. I remember. Marc: But remember the BBSs were all self-contained. Remember, in the early BBS days you would log into each BBS separately. Marc: There was no connectivity between the BBSs. There was no — so you had AOL at the time, you had AOL, CompuServe, and Prodigy, they were the three big ones. And you couldn’t even connect between those. Brian: So that’s where you were then? When you were working in the middle of the night — I had this question to ask you; I’m so glad you said that — like, what kind of like, how adrenalized were you when you were building Mosaic? I’m talking about the creative part of this; like how adrenalized were you when this was happening? Marc: Well, not really — this is the thing is the conventional wisdom was so against, it was a little bit — This is why I tell the story of the magazine, it’s just like, I just like I read the magazine and I’m just like, okay, my work doesn’t, I mean, not my; nobody knew who I was, but like, the entire domain in which I’m operating does not matter, does not even merit a mention. Like, it’s just like, okay, and I’m just like, I don’t know what, like, I’m just a kid. Like, I don’t know what else… so I just go back to work. Like, I can’t do any of this other stuff. I’m not at Time Warner building, you know, I don’t know, interactive TV. I’m not at Viacom building whatever VR thing they were doing. Like, I just, I’m working on this internet thing. And even though they don’t respect it, it’s the thing I can work on. So I’ll just work on it. And so, you know, we just went back to work. I didn’t know what else… so I just go back to work. Like, I can’t do any of this other stuff. We didn’t really start to get positive feedback until, you know, sort of spring ’93 — the feedback cycles, so what we did get is, we did get a positive feedback cycle going quickly — and the positive feedback cycle basically was not surprising. But like the more people who had browsers, then the more people who would put up web pages. The more people would put up web pages, the more people would want to have browsers. Brian: You started realizing that? Marc: Yeah, we started seeing that. Brian: And did that get exciting to you personally? Marc: Well, guess how I started to experience that? Marc: Customer support emails. Brian: Oh, that’s awesome, complaints! Marc: Right. Guess who got all the complaints? <laughs> Brian: That’s fantastic. So the complaints actually let you — now, were you, when you got the complaints, were you able to actually (and this might be one of the gifts you have) — were you able to immediately go like, “Ooh, this is good.” Marc: Yeah, sure. Of course. People care. Brian: Most of us would just crumble. Marc: People care. Well, people care. Okay, so here’s the funny part about it. This whole thing as being operated on a, it’s kind of a little bit of a rogue project, but it was funded under NSF grant, that R&D grant. So it was relevant enough to the grant that we’d gotten that we kind of were able to do that, that the center had gotten. So then literally, it starts to work and it starts to get adopted, and, so you know, it’s like, okay, this interesting. We start to get all these customer support emails and I’m like, I’ve got a choice. I can either like, answer all the emails or I can write more code. And so we actually wrote a grant application to the NSF to be able to hire a customer service team to be able to actually, like, help people get on the internet and do all this stuff. And guess what the reception was for that grant application? Brian: I can imagine. Brian: Yeah, of course it was denied. Because how are you gonna really explain — Marc: Well, and the NSF is not in the business of funding a customer support operation? Like, that’s something that — Brian: So did you rephrase it? Marc: No, no, no. They just flat out shot us down. And so I just worked more. Brian: So this is like, you just kept going. Marc: Yeah, I just kept going. And, you know, at some point — but then it took, right, and then this is the feedback loop thing, positive feedback loop took. So then the weirdest thing happened, which was people started writing books about it. And this is actually really significant because the PCs at the time didn’t actually have internet connectivity built into them. PCs and Macs at the time. You bought them out of the box. They didn’t have the software required to get on the internet, so. But there was enough demand that the book publishers started to write books about “how to internet” — and those books would have a floppy disk in the back of the book and the floppy disk had the software you needed to load in your PC so that you could get online. And so that took some of the load off the — finally, I could just say you should go read, you know, Internet for Dummies. And so that helped… Brian: And were you still like in college during all that? Marc: Yeah. Still in college, yeah. Brian: Still in college as it started to take off. Marc: Yeah, as it started to go. Brian: So here’s a question — and you can answer this as how you thought or what you’ve noticed in entrepreneurs — because it ties into the way, in a very small way, how I think, what I’ve experienced as a storyteller. And that is like, what does it feel like to hold two versions of the world in your head at the same time? That is, the way the world is and the way that it’s going to be. You know, because you’re kind of living in two different worlds at the same time. <Yup.> How have you seen that manifest, and how did it manifest for you? Marc: Yeah. So this is the line we use is the difference between a vision and a hallucination? Brian: Yes, talk about that please! Marc: And what’s the difference between a vision and a hallucination? Is other people can see the vision. Marc: Well, that’s the question, right? Brian: So what’s the time horizon? Marc: Well, that’s the thing. And so the way we think about this, the abstract way we think about this is, the best entrepreneurs, they really do live in the future. It’s actually, I think a little bit like the best artists. The best entrepreneurs live in the future, they actually can already envision, like, at some point — they maybe don’t have it at the very, very beginning, because you often start to scratch your own itch just to start — but like, at some point, you’re like, okay, like, I’m gonna put this thing out, everybody’s gonna like it. Like, everybody’s gonna use it. Like, at some point, it’s gonna take. And I can start to, and we didn’t start to develop this over time, you start to feel like, okay, this could be something that could really matter. This could be really big — and you start to kind of live in the world in which it’s sort of already happened. The best entrepreneurs and artists, they really do live in the future… Brian: Yes, that’s what I mean, about you’re living in two realities at the same time! Marc: Yeah, right. But then you have to come back to, you know, you wake up every morning and the world in which it hasn’t yet happened — Brian: Yah, eat your oatmean or whatever. Marc: You know, wake up, put your pants on. Brian: Did you find it distracting, inspiring? Marc: Inspiring. I mean, I think for the good… it’s almost always… well, let’s put it this way: It’s inspiring when it works. It’s very frustrating when it doesn’t. Brian: Yes. Because then it’s almost like a whole world has died in a way. Marc: Yeah, this whole future that you were able to envision. And by the way, every entrepreneur views that like they’re doing something to make the world better. People don’t go through the effort… Brian: And you did that when you were building the web browser, you decided, you did, some part of you thought… Marc: Nobody does a creative endeavor thinking, “Boy, this is gonna make the world worse. I can’t wait to see how bad I can make the world.” Brian: Well, can you talk about the difference between having a dream and having a, like, sort of chasing your personal passion — and then personal contribution. Like, deciding that your dream has utility beyond yourself? Marc: Yeah, so this is something where Ben — Ben actually gave a commencement speech (where he and I developed this jointly, but he did the speech and riled a bunch of people up) — so basically, our view is that the “follow your passion” thing is like an incredibly destructive meme that sort of flows out of the kind of hippie movement of the 60s– Brian: You have to define “passion” for me because — Marc: So, I have a internalized view of myself, and what I am on planet earth to do. I have to express myself as a — take your pick: a musician, an author, a writer, a programmer, a basket weaver, a whatever it happens to be, an organic farmer — like, whatever the thing, that’s my passion. And that’s my passion. And my passion, it’s about me. This is our view, that it’s a self-centered view of the world. This is what’s going to make ME happy. This is what MY calling is. This is the thing that’s gonna actualize me. And if I can follow my passion, then I will be validated, right, and I will be a success within my own psyche. And if I can’t, I’ll be frustrated and angry and bitter, and all the rest of it. And the problem is, is that like, so the problem is like, it goes back to our earlier discussion. Like, if take is given, the rest of the world’s gonna appreciate your passion, right? And like I said, like, the rest of the world is busy. Like, maybe they will, maybe they won’t. And so the way we always encourage people to think about it is, basically, follow the area in which you can make a contribution. So it’s not about you, it’s about other people. It’s the non-selfish version of it. The non-selfish version of it is, what can I do that’s gonna make other people’s lives better, what can I do that’s gonna be of service and value to them? And then the question is, okay, well, then how am I gonna know? Well, because they’re gonna actually, they’re gonna buy it. Like, how about that? They’re gonna pay money for it. Brian: Yeah, you’re not saying don’t try your passion. You’re saying measure — it sounds to me you’re saying measure? Marc: Well, I don’t think, I think ”your passion” is inherently a self-centric view and I think that’s — Brian: You think it’s destructive to the individual to think about it as scratching a passion? Marc: Yes. I think it leads– Brian: But aren’t the best engineers dissatisfied by something and then they have to try to make it better? Marc: Yeah, but that’s the difference. Making it better is not just I wrote the code. Making it better is everybody now uses the code. And maybe that sounds obvious — especially for people who are already highly successful, it sounds like those are the same thing. You get this thing in the advice industry, right, in which you get a lot of self-selected advice; you know, a lot of the how-to succeed books it’s like, step one, be successful, right? Making it better is not just I wrote the code. Making it better is everybody now uses the code. Brian: It goes back to Steve Martin. How can I be a millionaire and never pay taxes? Step one, get a million dollars. That’s he says <laughs>, right, step one, get a million dollars. Marc: Right. And so anyway, the point being like, it’s just, what I just find with a lot of people, it’s not that there’s nothing to the passion idea, it’s just with a lot of people, it leads to — If they exercise their passion, if the world does not then automatically appreciate their passion it leads to bitterness, and resentment, and envy, and anger, and it just leads people to, it’s very sabotaging. And philosophically, I would say, of course it’s sabotaging because it’s self-centric because we’re not islands. Like, the world is not just a bunch of disassociated individuals. Like, we are a society. Brian: No, it is a loop. Writing Billions made me incredibly happy and I do say, in the writing alone or with Dave, but in the writing, that is in a way the happiest that it gets. <Okay.> But then that’s the one sort of, that’s the just purely sort of pure emotion and you’re right, it’s selfish. But the fact that it’s then — I get the feedback — that it’s making people happy, really is what elevates. Marc: People watch it, they love it. They’re watching it in the numbers. And it’s like– and then by the way, then that’s how you get the money and then the money is what you use to do more of what you… And there’s like, not only is there nothing wrong with that, there’s something really right about that. Brian: I mean, I do encourage people to chase their passion because I think if they don’t they also become better. But again, these things are all like — what does Ferriss call it? um, “minimum effective dose” — and so, the minimum effective dose might be, keep your job, do your thing, and you work a half hour a day to figure out if your passion is gonna lead to this contribution. Marc: I guess I’d say, I think — I find it natural, maybe this is the Midwestern in me — I always found it natural to say like, look, my creative output, it is right and appropriate and proper for it to be evaluated by other people. I would like to know what other people think of it. I would like to know that they appreciate it. I would like to see that they use it. I would like to see that it has an effect on their lives– Brian: But how does that square with the fact that you hold– like, how does that square with willingness to make bets that go against what the majority think? Brian: So can you talk about those, right? Because you’re actually not ceding power to those people. Marc: That’s right… Quite the opposite. Brian: Talk about that bit. Marc: We talk about this a lot. So this is the old — this is the old Steve Jobs thing. Nobody ever asked for a Macintosh. <Right!> So this is the thing. This is actually another kind of dysfunction you see among some startup founders. Big companies often have this dysfunction, which is (I actually saw this when I was at IBM, they had this problem in the 90s) — it was, we’re gonna do what the customer wants. We’re a customer-centric organization. Brian: That’s not what you’re saying. Marc: It’s not what I’m saying it all! Because the customers don’t know what they want. Like, nobody ever asked for a Macintosh. Nobody ever asked for a car. I mean, people were on horses, and they thought they were fine. Nobody asked for an automobile. Nobody asked for, I can tell you, nobody asked for the internet. Like, they didn’t know. They didn’t know. Why didn’t they know? It’s not their job to know. As I said, people are busy. And I think this is very much is a human nature thing. People are busy, people have their own lives, they got their own priorities, they got their own things. They’re not sitting around dreaming up new product ideas that they hope somebody else builds. They’re just not doing it. And so you have to invent it, and you have to bring it to them. But without the attitude of, you know, I now get to dictate to you how you receive it, right? Brian: So how does that square with this idea of people evaluating it? Like, how do you know that, right, ‘cause I guess it’s easier language for somebody internally — I have a feeling, and I’m gonna exercise my passion — than it is to have the belief in their ability to contribute. So how do you square those things? Marc: Well, the ability to contribute is, it’s just like, it’s almost like a spirit of generosity. <Brian: That’s great.> Can I envision that there are people, who are otherwise busy, can I envision — you know, for you, I can envision there are people who are like TV fans and they’re watching TV shows and they really like TV shows, and can I envision that I might be able to make a TV show that they might enjoy more than the ones they’re already watching — and would that make their life… And the answer is like, yeah, they probably would. Brian: But when you do something that there is no analog for previously. In the beginning, I’m sure you’ve seen most people collect many rejections. Brian: So talk a little bit about this, right? Because how does someone — I don’t want someone to misinterpret what you’re saying as, hey, if you poke your head out and someone takes a whack at it, you are in the wrong line of work, right? So how do you balance those ideas? How do you square this idea that, you’re gonna run through a lot of rejections before success; with, hey, make sure you check the market to make sure you’re getting some positive reinforcement. How do those things square? Marc: So Sean Parker says — for tech startups — the thing about tech startups is they’re like chewing glass. Eventually, you start to like the taste of your own blood, right? Right, like there’s a marketing of like tech startups is like a glamorous thing. And I actually don’t agree with that for the most part. They are actually brutally, brutally difficult. And it goes back to the Test that we talked about. You are, every single day as a startup founder, you’re trying to get employees to join you who have many other options. Most of them are telling you no. You’re trying to get customers to test your product or buy your products, they’re busy, they have other stuff going on. Most of them tell you no. You’re trying to raise money, most of the, you know, VCs tell you no. Like, generally, it’s just all day long as a tech founder is, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Brian: And what do you have to tell yourself? What do you have to tell yourself, eventually, they’ll see that I am contributing? Marc: Yeah. Yeah, basically. Yeah. I mean… they’re wrong. Well, it’s actually sort of an interesting thing, there has to be a part, this is where the chip on the shoulder comes in handy. There has to be a thing of like, basically, screw them. Like, I know I’m right and I know they’re wrong. Or at least I have a strong idea in that direction and I’m willing to fight my way through it. And by the way, it’s like, you know, it’s like, at some point, you realize the nos aren’t killing you, right? Marc: Right? And that’s like a big… You know, this is kind of, it’s also why, by the way, it’s really good for engineers to learn sales, is because sales people hear “no” for a living, right? A friend of mine is absolutely fearless, he’s a VC now, but he’s a fearless kind of sales-oriented personality, and I figured out what happened. He got a job in high school selling steak knives door to door and he did that, you know, for two years. Brian: And the best that ever is second prize as you know. Marc: Exactly. But it’s like 99 out of 100 times he gets the door slammed in his face, because like, who wants to buy steak knives in the middle of the afternoon from like, a 16- year-old kid. But, you know, every once in a while, he would sell a set. Any other challenge he put in front of himself is really easy because it doesn’t have that level of rejection. And so at some point, you get comfortable with rejection. So that’s like an attitudinal thing. And then the other thing is, look, you do get feedback; like, sometimes, you know, sometimes it isn’t quite right, right? And, you know, because there’s two sides to it: The customer didn’t ask for a Macintosh, but once they got their hands on a Macintosh, they had lots of feedback. Like, the thing is too slow, is too expensive. It’s this, it’s that, the screen share… Brian: And you can take that feedback. Marc: You can take the feedback, right? And again, it’s the spirit of generosity. Like, if they’re giving you the feedback in the spirit of, okay, this is very promising, but it’s not quite right for me yet because of X, Y, Z. Like, that’s generosity on their part to give you the feedback. Brian: Did you have to train yourself to handle the criticism, or you were just naturally good at processing it? Because some people crumble. Like, I know I had to train myself. Marc: I think it was the Wired thing. It was soo universally accepted — it was even when I actually even got out here even in ’94, it was so universally accepted — that the internet was not going to be a thing, that I kind of had gotten used to it. And it wasn’t even so much that I — so, okay, so I’ll tell you another story on this. So I come out here, you know, one of my great kind of strokes of luck in my life was meeting my partner, Jim Clark. And so he was a legendary founder at the time. And so he and I decided to start a company and it became Netscape. You might think, oh, it’s obvious idea, browser company, like, most obvious thing in the world. It’s like, no, that wasn’t what happened at all because we knew the internet wasn’t gonna be a big deal because, you know, this is like, not just Wired magazine, this is Time magazine, this is New York Times, and it’s the endless litany of experts, and politicians, and everybody, and big company executives. Brian: Yeah. Microsoft– Marc: Microsoft and Oracle and all these companies were just like, this thing’s a joke. Like, this thing’s absurd. And it’s gonna be these other things. And so we actually tried to start, at the time, version one, we tried to start an interactive TV software company because everybody, all the experts said that was gonna be the thing. And Jim’s previous company was actually building a lot of these interactive TV systems. And so we tried to start a company to do that. We actually, that took us kind of in contact with the actual market; we then went out and kind of did a market survey of like, okay, how many interactive TV systems are actually alive? How many of them are actually working? And the answer was zero. So we were like, okay, wait. Like, hold on a second. Like, this is not actually — Peter Thiel talks about the concept of a secret, this is like, the thing that you believe that’s correct that nobody else believes — and like the secret actually turned out to be interactive TV was not a thing. There’s an ocean of marketing — Brian: I love that. Tony Gilroy talks about the secret thing too in my side of the street. But yeah, having a special secret. When you have it, when you know your idea is worth doing. It’s what it feels like, it’s the special secret that you have, and everyone’s gonna freak out when it shows up. <Right. Yup.> He talks about that. Marc: Yeah, and it’s often — it’s not even so much you’re right about something everybody else is wrong about — it’s more like they can’t even possibly believe. Like, it’s inconceivable that it could be true. Like, a lot of these things are actually sitting there in plain sight. It’s just the conventional wisdom becomes so strong, it’s sort of bucking the conventional wisdom and kind of the right way. So we concluded, like, that wasn’t gonna happen. Then we basically had the idea of — we were not the only ones — we had the idea for what today might be called Xbox Live, or Playstation Network, sort of, you know, interactive gaming. And Nintendo was coming out with this great new Nintendo 64, which was like a real computer for gaming console for the first time. And so we said, let’s build an interactive gaming network, an online service for Nintendo 64. Then we looked at that, and then Nintendo 64 wasn’t gonna come out for two years, and then who even knew if it was gonna work. And so that was not gonna be a thing. And so we actually used process of elimination to work our way back to like, I guess it’s gonna have to be the internet. Like, the internet is the only thing that’s actually working. Like, it’s the only thing that’s actually working; it’s the only thing that actually has people using it; it’s the only thing that actually is growing; it’s the only thing that actually has people building content for it. And it’s being completely dismissed by the establishment, but it’s actually working. And that’s actually one of the great themes of our time in venture capital, which was like, the best case scenario for us is the thing that’s working that everybody’s laughing at, like, that’s our catnip. Brian: Right. And even if it’s a small — Marc: Yeah. It doesn’t have to be big. Brian: What you’re saying is, so the industry is saying no, but if you get little blips, you can take your encouragement in very micro doses. Marc: Well — yes, that’s correct — in particular, what you’re looking for is in that case, you’re looking for the feedback loop. Brian: Yes. Engagement. Marc: Engagement. So you’re looking one user’s recommend the next, recommend to the next, recommend to the next, recommend to the next. Or you’re looking for the two-way feedback loop which we have with the browser and web server. Computers had this in the old days, you knew the Mac was gonna work when every time somebody bought a Mac, it made it more likely somebody would build a piece of software for the Mac, every new piece of software made it more likely somebody would buy a Mac. So it’s called the network effect of an operating system. Brian: Seth Godin talks about it ratcheting up, ratcheting up. Marc: Yeah. Exactly. Virtuous cycle, kind of thing. And so, to be fair, just because you see them early doesn’t mean they all get big. Like, that’s not how the world works. They don’t all get there, but all of the ones that got big started with that kind of small initial, as you say, micro dosing of the feedback. And then in our business, you know, there’s asymmetric risk/ return. And so basically, you wanna find the thing where you do have some evidence — you have early evidence that it’s gonna have that kind of phenomenon — and then everybody laughing at it is awesome, because that means it’s out of consensus, right? And that means it’s like, people literally do not believe in it. And then as a consequence, like, if it does work, if it keeps growing, there will be an inversion at some point, and all of a sudden, the entire world will go, Oh! And at that point, it becomes like immediately gigantically valuable. Brian: Well, this is one of my favorite Hollywood quotes ever. Do you know the Jack Nicholson quote when he saw this agent? Do you know it, where they said to him, “We might not need you but when we need you, we’re gonna need your really badly.” <laughs> We’re really gonna need you. Like, you’re gonna be completely not hirable, and then suddenly you’re gonna be the biggest movie star in the world. And that must repeat is… Just a couple more things, you once told me (I think like the first time we met), that you love to be proven wrong, that one of the things you love is to have a core convinced ideology about something and then to be able to accept in a flash that — Can you talk a little bit about that? About why that’s valuable, and about how you either trained yourself, or just were that way, and what the gains are of living that way? Marc: So I’ll start with saying it’s aspirational. Brian: <laughs> Yes, sure. Marc: So I’ve actually tried to figure out why this is. So people treat their ideas like their children. And I’ve actually tried, gone back, I’ve been reading, doing a lot of reading in like psychology and neurology. Brian: Well, a lot of behavioral economics is about this idea that we fall in love with the — we get wed to this, thing. Marc: Yeah. So I think… I finally figured out why this is the case. I think it literally is, it seems like we’re treating our ideas like our children. I think we’re literally treating our ideas like they’re our children. So I think it’s an evolutionary thing. People treat their ideas like their children. And then anytime that idea gets challenged, you get the threat response. I think in the evolutionary context in which our genetics were developed, right, because our genetics are unchanged over the last 50,000 years, effectively. Fifty thousand years ago, there weren’t really ideas. There were just children! <laughs> Like, you’re not sitting around the campfire speculating on, like, abstract theories of life. You’re like trying to get through the freakin’ day and then you’ve got this infant and you’re desperately trying to keep the infant alive. And so we’ve got this like, there’s something — Brian: The territorial protectiveness. Marc: Yeah. Like, this is my thing. This is my offspring. This is my legacy. This is everything valuable and important to me, is like right here in my hands and it’s gonna die without me and like, my god, I have to like emotionally lock in. And I have to do all these irrational things, you know, to protect it. You know, anybody that’s had kids, like, your entire priority ordering like, neurologically changes when you have kids. And so basically, I think literally what happened is, like, literally, now we live in a world of ideas — we weren’t like, you know, it’s weird, like, the whole concept of ideas comes from kind of rationality which somehow showed up on our wiring — but like, we still have this kind of legacy wiring and the legacy wiring basically says, okay, now this idea is my kid. Like, this is the thing I believe in, I wanna protect, I wanna foster, I wanna nurture, I wanna grow, it’s part of my passion. And then anytime that idea gets challenged, you get the threat response. So somebody is challenging your kid, you feel it. You feel it in your like, limbic system is like; your pulse rises; your back, you know, gets up; you know, you flush. You know, people get defensive, you get the defensive reaction. It’s like, why are you defending an abstract idea? Like, nothing’s going to happen to you. Brian: Right. But you’re right about what it feels. Marc: But yet, you act like it. Brian: So, how do you go look for that then? Marc: So here’s the problem: most of your ideas are wrong. Like, let’s say especially if you’re in my business. And let’s even say especially if you’re me! Like, most of the ideas are wrong. And so at some point, the thing I figured, I started doing the backtest, in finance, we call the “backtests”, which is basically — okay, I’m gonna take whatever algorithm or system I have for trying to figure out what’s gonna happen in the future, whatever set of rules I’ve derived on kind of how the world works and how to predict things — let me go back and backtest. I’m gonna imagine, you know, I’m gonna imagine Larry Page and Sergey Brin walk in the door and they pitch Google. And this is difficult because at the surface level you’re gonna be like, Google, obvious, whatever. But it actually turns out there were a bunch of VCs, very smart VCs who turned down Google. And I know that — Brian: And can I just historically, was AltaVista already a thing? Brian: So AltaVista was the default and Ask Jeeves, were those the two? Marc: And all these… Google was like number 35. Brian: Okay. And Yahoo, I guess. Marc: So there were two things everybody knew about search engines. Marc: Two things everybody knew. One is they all suck. Like, there’s no way to make a good one, right, because the internet — Brian: And that was a core rule that everyone believed. Marc: Yeah, yeah. They are all trash. Like, they just, they don’t work because the internet’s messy and so you just can’t organize like, you know, there’s all this weird stuff out there and you just can’t — like, it doesn’t work. And then even if it works, there’s no way to make money on it. It’s not possibly gonna be a business. There’s just no way. And so the view of search at the time was literally, search at the time, there was actually — the business model was it was a loss leader for the portal business. And it was literally a loss leader, and you actually had to spend money to provide a search engine that you lost money on. Brian: Because they weren’t advertising on search? Marc: Well, there was advertising, it was like a banner ad. But they didn’t have the AdWords, the AdWords model didn’t exist yet, right? And so it hadn’t yet been invented. And so literally, like, and I have friends who, like, I have friends who were very successful VCs who passed on Google and part of it was, there’s no business model. Like, this thing is just gonna burn money forever, it’s never gonna make any money. And the guys had no theory on how to make money when they started this thing. And so the backtest is like, okay, apply all your fancy theories today how you value businesses, and then congratulations, you just missed Google. Like, you know, give yourself a pat on the back, well done. Brian: And the purpose of the backtest is to make you be open to having your assumptions questioned… Is that correct? Marc: Yeah, 100%. Really, it’s the limits of your knowledge, like, how much can you actually know? Like, what’s your basic operating model. Well, I would take it so far as to say, I don’t know that there actually are VCs that can predict whether any given thing is gonna succeed or fail. Period. Full stop. Including us. Like, I’m not even sure that’s actually part of the value we provide. I actually think that might literally be zero of our contribution to the entire process. And I say that of like, we have no sure — Brian: That’s what you make decision — isn’t that what you make a decision based on? Marc: Well, no… Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe not. Brian: Talk a little more about that. Marc: Maybe we’re actually in the people business as opposed to the ideas business. And maybe what we should be trying to sniff out are the people. And maybe the point of sniffing out the people is the people are gonna be the ones who are gonna go figure all this stuff out. Right. So I read a paper that also… Maybe we’re actually in the people business as opposed to the ideas business. Brian: Power to the people. Marc Andreessen. Marc: Exactly. There’s a great VC, there’s a legendary VC, Arthur Rock, from the 60s through the 90s, who funded Intel and Apple and like he was like one of the main, he was like a hugely important figure of the era and still is a highly respected person. He wrote a paper at the end of his venture career and he analyzed his results. And there’s two ways to make mistakes in venture capital. There’s the I fund something that fails and then there’s the I don’t fund something that succeeds, right? And it actually turns out the asymmetry of risk return, I fund something that fails is really not a problem. I don’t fund something that succeeds really is a problem. Right, and so he analyzed his returns and he concluded after 30 years of venture, he concluded he would have had better results had he shredded all the business plans upon receipt and never read them, and only worked against the resumes. Marc: …against the resumes. I guess the people. <Right.> If he had just purely been evaluating the people, he would have been much better. Brian: That makes sense to me actually. Marc: Of course, that begs the whole question of how do you evaluate the people? But the point is like, it may not be a predictive model against the ideas. I’ll give you another one, eBay. Like, a lot of people believe they could have funded eBay. Well, it’s like, okay, you need to picture 1995, right? You’ve got, how about we do this? How about somebody wants to buy something on the internet so badly that they go to the post office and they buy a money order, which is the only way to pay for things on eBay when it got venture funded. And then let’s imagine somebody wants to buy something SO much, that they’re gonna send the money order to the person who claims to be selling it and then that person is actually going to send the thing. Brian: I remember eBay seemed crazy to — I remember being really nervous to use eBay the first time I used it. I remember being really nervous about it. Like, wait, I don’t understand, I did; I remember being like, this seems nuts! Marc: One of the jokes of the internet industry today is basically the internet — the internet, they’re all things that adults always told you not to do. Like, do not get in a car with strangers. Right? Lyft and Uber, right? Do not like, stay at a stranger’s house overnight. Airbnb, right? Do not send people money in the mail without knowing whether– Brian: When someone makes the eye-crossing app then we’re really gonna kill it. <laughs> Marc: Exactly. By the way, for sure, don’t go on a date with somebody you meet online because that’s just — Brian: That’s terrible. Marc: So anyway, so the point of the backtest basically is like, okay, test your own bullshit of like, okay, I now have all these rules. Okay. So now apply the backtest. And the backtest basically says, is like, these rules– like, they’re only so useful and there’s only so much you can assume. And so therefore, but at the same time, so that’s part one, at the same time, you can’t just then go into a mode of like, okay, everything’s ambiguous, I don’t know and you just shrug and everything, right? You can’t have NO point of view because then you won’t be able to differentiate between anything. And so where we’ve come out is what we call it is we call it “strong views, weekly held”. So it’s like, let’s have a very strong point of view of this kind of guide our search kind of through the landscape and tell us kind of what to focus on based on some theory that we’ve developed. But then let’s be really open to the disconfirming evidence that basically says that and then let’s be willing to do a complete 180. Brian: And then the other side, the people piece, and we can talking about this is, I guess when those companies — what’s the term you guys, when someone starts a company that’s supposed to do something, and then they realize it’s supposed to be something else? Marc: These days is called “the pivot”. Brian: Right. The pivot. Marc: In my era, it was called “the fuck up”. Brian: Right. The pivot. So but like, Slack, it was a different business, right? <That’s right.> So is that an example we’re betting on the person, is that one of the things that you go, well, we were totally wrong about the business, but we were totally right that Stewart was gonna figure it. Marc: Yeah, that’s right. So this is part of the payoff of betting on the best people if you can figure out who they are. Part of the path is they will get you to the promised land. Not always, but they’ll have a pretty good chance. You know, they’re injecting into the complex adaptive system that is the world, they are gonna get all kinds of feedback including your ideas, dominant is never gonna work. Like, genuinely isn’t gonna work, which is the feedback Stewart got, which we could talk about. And then they’re going to have the wherewithal, psychology, motivation, all the rest of it to be able to scale, talent, leadership ability, right? Because they gotta bring people with them, right? To be able to get to the other thing. Brian: Okay. Oh, this is really good. And we can — because I have no idea how this would work — So you’ve witnessed a part of it. You know, you’ve led a group of people, you’ve raised money and you’ve made the assault, and then you look up and, you know, the arrows are through everybody’s chest. How, how do you counsel people? And how does the pivot actually — because all of us can, it ties into this emotional connection to our idea — how do you teach and talk about, to a founder, who you still think, a founder who’s actually in the failure proven to you, they still have it? How do you talk about what it means to pivot? And what inner resources are required to pivot? And then what do you see your role as in helping them pivot. Marc: Right. So I would say there’s a couple different situations. Every once in a while you work with a founder who just gives up too quick and then you got to encourage them to keep going because it’s just too early. We try to keep them going because you know, we’re not big into this fail fest. So we think failing, first of all, is failing and we think failing is horrible. So we don’t like that part of it. So generally, we don’t generally have that problem. Sometimes the easy case is you have somebody who’ll come to you and say like, “I think we got feedback from market, I think it’s not gonna work. Help me figure out.” Brian: Help me figure out with the tools we have, what else we can pick? Marc: Yeah. How to get there. And then usually, they’re asking us like, will you support us through this process? And the answer is usually yes. If they’ve comported themselves well, right, if they’ve been honest and ethical and, you know, all the rest of the things you expect from a professional then generally we’ll let them go take a second or third swing, you know, for as long as the money lasts. And then there’s kind of the hardest case which is, um, and we’ve had these, where it’s like, it’s like year four, your five, year six, the thing’s not working and they don’t wanna quit. They don’t wanna give up. And they really should. And the reason they really should is because fundamentally, the reason they really should, they’re not gonna be able to hold the team. Like, best case, they’re gonna be out there by themselves still pursuing this thing. These are team sports. And so they’re not gonna able to hold the people. And so basically you’ve got a practicing start — you got four or five years in practice to get one of the things to work and it doesn’t work after that. Brian: How did the Slack pivot happen? Marc: So Slack, part of it is Stewart had done it before. So this was his second time doing it. His first big success was called Flickr. Flickr was another one of these where it was, Flickr was a pivot. So part of it is Stewart’s actually a world expert. Marc: He’s now done this twice. He’s a world expert on the topic. His technique, I would say we supported him doing it, but he deserves all the credit. He uses the bottle of Irish whiskey strategy, which is… He’s Irish and so he literally like shows up with the team. And he’s like, gets out the bottle of whiskey and pours everybody shots. Brian: <laughs> That’s state change. Marc: Yeah, yeah. It’s like, I’m gonna tell you the truth. And the truth of that point was we built this desktop video game called Glitch that was completely dependent on this technology called Flash, and the reality is Steve Jobs just decided to put a bullet in Flash. He’s not gonna support the iPhone, like, it’s done. And the reality is like, all this work we put into it for the last, you know, three years or whatever, like, it’s for nothing. It’s for zero. Like, bad news, here, have another drink. And then basically, we now have a choice. You know, we are a tribe, right? –nNow, there’s a Paleolithic component to this — our hunting party now has a choice. You know, do we quit? Do we give up and all disperse and go to different things and join different tribes? Or, you know, do we think we have an idea and the motivation to pursue something different? And it turns out, they had this, in both of his pivots, they had the core of the new thing figured out. They had developed the Slack collaboration system as a way to help them all work together… it was an internal tool. Brian: That was an internal thing? For themselves. And then did he come to you and show you that? Marc: Yeah, yeah. Well, it wasn’t so much even to show us, it was more just like, I have this idea. I mean, yeah, he showed, but fundamentally it was like, I have an idea. I think this could be a thing. Brian: And you guys were just still willing to bet on him. Marc: Yeah, yeah. Well, so there’s a famous case, there’s actually a famous case. So this is where Twitter came from, by the way, the same thing. So Twitter was not a startup. The startup was called Odeo. And Odeo actually was podcasting. So, the story of a podcasting app called Odeo that went to market 10 years before podcasting became a big deal. And nobody — this is like pre-iPhone, pre-Bluetooth headset, like, pre-4G and 5G networks. Like, download the podcast on your mp3 player. It was just too early for the podcast. So Ev Williams, and Jack Dorsey, and these people created this thing called Odeo. It flatlined. They worked and worked and worked, and then they had this little idea on the side of Twttr. T-W-T-T-R, based on Jack’s experience as a bicycle messenger of all things — basically short messaging, what’s in computer science called publish-subscribe messaging; it was a known computer science idea but it had never been built into a consumer service before — and so they had this thing on the side. And so Ev was the CEO, he went back to his VCs and he said, you know, “You have a choice, I’ll give you your money back — I’ll give you the remaining money back — or you can roll it into this new thing called Twttr.” And the legend is one of the venture firm said, Yes, let’s roll it. The other venture firm took their money back. You know, which turned into a… Brian: And how did that end? Marc: Today, that’s like a $5 billion difference in outcomes. Just for that venture firm. Brian: Did the other firm survive? Marc: Uh, yah, they’re still alive. Now look, everybody makes mistakes. The only moral of the story there was, look, if you’ve got an Ev Williams, if you got a Stewart Butterfield, and we’re not talking about half a billion dollars — Brian: Were you evaluating someone, when Stewart came to you — just to end this — when Stewart came to you, are you and Ben and your team, hey, the thing we all signed on to do isn’t working. I have this new idea. How much of your time is spent crunching the idea versus how much of it is, right. So, it’s all just you went, “yes, Stewart, keep going”. Marc: Well, I mean, the idea made sense. So the idea made — so, part of it is just the idea is right in the center of how we, the idea is right in the center of our idea universe. It’s a collaborative messaging service. And Ben and I, Netscape, we built — like, I’ve been working on those for a long time. So, we kind of knew that general. It was a plausible idea. It wasn’t cold fusion. It was a totally plausible idea. And then Stewart just at that point had become a very known quantity. And it wasn’t even so much — part of it was, we thought Stewart had acquitted himself very well, including the fact that he was willing to make this change. Brian: To come to you and say it’s over. Marc: Yeah. And he was very clear with us, right? And was very respectful of us. And so he was great. But also we knew him from Flickr. So we have the concept of game film, right? The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior and we knew that he had actually been through this exact situation before. He’d came out the other end with Flickr which was a great achievement. And so it was like of all — that was the easy one because of all the people in the world to bet on to do this, Stewart’s the obvious one. Brian: Well, Marc, I’m so grateful that you spent this time. Thank you, man. Great talk to you. And Marc is on Twitter, but the most you’re gonna get is to see things that he likes. That’s it. Marc: Not anymore, man. Total stealth mode. Brian: You don’t even like things anymore? Marc: I am the Soviet nuclear submarine. Brian: There’s that, even the guy who constantly says what you like, he’s had to stop? Marc: Under the Arctic Circle. Yeah. The pmarca-likes bot is in… Marc: He’s on hiatus. Brian: I would always crack up when I would get one of them, if you’d like one of my tweets and then suddenly I would see this, and I was like, “What is this bot?” So you can’t find Marc online, sorry. But you can read about him in books and maybe if he makes another podcast appearance somewhere… in his own podcast. Brian: And what’s your podcast? Marc: The “a16z podcast”. Marc: Available on every podcast player. Yes. Brian: I’ll be on next Saturday. So this is gonna go up Tuesday, that should be up on Saturday, me on Marc’s — the podcast he does with Sonal. So, all right, everybody, you can find me @BrianKoppelman. You can write me at themomentbk@gmail.com. Do not send me a proposal to get to Marc Andreessen. I will throw it out. And don’t send me a screenplay ‘cause I’ll also throw that out. But if you’re friends with any like, screenwriters or VCs, maybe we’ll be able to do something. All right, everybody. Thanks.

{"text":"This interview was recorded earlier this year and originally appeared on The Observer Effect; it has only been lightly edited for formatting here. Let’s get into it. Over a decade ago, you wrote a famous post called the ‘Pmarca guide to productivity‘. What is the 2020 version of the Marc Andreessen guide to productivity? The big thing is I’ve basically done a complete 180 degrees off of the model that I had from 13-14 years ago. A lot of that was just driven by starting and then scaling this firm. At this point we have a large number of companies in the portfolio and a large number of investments in the works at any point in time. The sheer load of the number of things coming at me and coming at the senior partners here is just very intense. That has forced a comprehensive shift to a far more structured way of living. It’s actually by far the most structured I’ve ever been. The typical day for me right now is quite literally following the calendar very closely. I’m trying to have as “programmed” a day as I possibly can. Walk me through what a day looks like. I should start by saying that none of what follows would be possible without the help of my amazing and indefatigable assistant Arsho Avetian. She’s been my secret weapon for more than 20 years. It’s more by week than by day. The day of the week determines a lot. Monday and Friday have very specific schedules because we run in the rhythm of a venture capital firm. There’s an all day sort-of marathon on Monday which is when most of the actual teamwork happens. We also use Friday for that. Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Thursdays are much more open ended. Those tend to be a lot more outwards-facing and have lots of board meetings, entrepreneur counsels and so on. Running Monday through Friday in this kind of regimented schedule, I do now finally understand why people have the concept of a weekend. I’m trying my best to preserve Saturday and Sunday for at least a little bit of downtime. In your old post you talked about Arnold Schwarzenegger’s open calendar and the upside of having unstructured time in your day and the flexibility you get with that. When Arnold did that interview I think he was in “entrepreneur mode”. At the time he was engaged in lots of entrepreneurial projects and starting lots of new businesses. I think there’s certainly virtue to that if you’re an entrepreneur in heavy creation mode. I lived a fair amount like that earlier in my career when I was programming. Basically working on exactly one thing all the time until you’re exhausted and collapse. And then get up the next morning and work on that thing some more. I never really had a calendar. I just knew what I was working on. In a sense, that’s the same as having no schedule.The challenge obviously shows up when you’re trying to do anything that involves either running an organization or being in a customer service role. That is how we think about parts of what we do now. If part of your job is to deal with a large amount of incoming, you actually need to respond in a timely manner and not let people down. Maybe some people can do that off the cuff. I don’t know how to do that. Was there a moment when you decided to change your old system? Was it when you founded the firm? Yeah, honestly, when we started the firm in 2009 we just got right into it. It was just a hurricane of new activity. We had decided one of the values of the firm is respect for the people we work with. And part of that respect is — we don’t drop balls. We respond quickly and we have SLAs on getting back to people in a specific period of time. We use the old JP Morgan saying of “first class business in a first class way”. If you contact us, you’re going to get a response. If we commit to doing something, we’re going to do that thing. It was just a necessity to be able to have some sort of system. Venture capital, I think, is very “close to the ground” work. The VCs who have tried to abstract themselves from the day to day have not done well. You have to really know what’s going on. You have to really be in close touch with what’s happening in these markets and with these technologies and where these entrepreneurs are. And you have to be talking to a lot of people all the time, right? It just necessitates a more structured approach. You’re waking up on Monday morning, or on a Sunday night, you’re looking at your calendar, what are you thinking? I’m thinking “God, I’m organized! I have a plan!”. If I didn’t have this, I’d be in a panic the very first moment I wake up. The big thing is basically *everything* is on the calendar. Sleep is on the calendar, going to bed is in there and so is free time. Free time is critical because that’s the release valve. You can work full tilt for a long time as long as you know you have actual time for yourself coming up. I find if you don’t schedule enough free time, you get resentful of your own calendar. When I was younger, I didn’t really have the concept of turning off. But there comes a time, a little bit with age, when your body rebels. And obviously, if you have a family, that’s not great with a system where you’re just always working. The value of open time and delegation One of the things I find interesting about your calendar is that there is a lot of allocated open space. We’ve often spoken about how some of the most interesting, influential people in the world tend to have large chunks of open space. As opposed to executives who are scheduled for every 30 minutes back to back from 8am to 7pm. You know, we’ve both worked with executives where they were scheduled to the ‘nth’ degree. The three things you tend to notice with executives like that. One, they just never have any time to actually think. And that turns out to be a fairly important thing. Two, they have a hard time adjusting to changes in circumstances. In our business of venture capital, you get a lot of problems that come up. There is a lot of firefighting. It’s like those classic movie scenes when there’s a huge crisis and somebody calls out to their secretary “Cancel my schedule!”. Well, maybe you wouldn’t need to do that if you had some flexibility in your calendar. Then the other thing you’ve probably seen is the managers who are regimented to that degree end up being micro managers. You’ve probably seen examples of this where some of these folks end up in the weeds on everything. The good news is they’ve got the pulse of everything happening in the organization. The bad news is they’ve become the bottleneck. The extreme form — and I’ve worked with a couple of people like this — end up having a long line outside their office. The lines will stretch waaaay down the hallway with people waiting to get in and see them. They kind of bottleneck your organization too. It’s demoralizing to work in an organization like that because basically, whatever that is, it’s the opposite of delegation. A related topic is delegation. For a lot of those folks, it’s hard to let go. Delegation can often be a platitude. It’s easy to talk about but in practice a lot of people struggle with it. So when you want to clear up open space on your calendar, how do you do it? How do you *actually* say, “I am not going to do this”, “I’m going to say no”, or “I’m going to have someone else do this”. Yeah, well, the good news is because of the way I run things, I don’t directly manage anybody. You’re a very unusual person for me to do these sets of interviews with because you’re not a traditional CEO running a huge organization. That’s right. So that’s necessarily going to be different, at least to some degree. I don’t have the pressure of all of the one on ones, all the management responsibilities. I’m involved in a fair amount of management stuff for the firm but it’s stuff that we cover in our internal meetings. And then we’ve got all these incredible people to manage all these teams.What we all kind of have to do at some point is to figure out how to just say no and triage the incoming. Which may be good segue to these text files that you sent me a screenshot of. Every executive has to have their own check-in system. You have finite time and you have a bunch of projects you care about that you need to keep an eye on. What’s your system to make this work? So basically, there’s two kinds of projects. Apple has this concept they call the directly responsible individual, the D.R.I. For any project, I’ve tried to identify the DRI. Who is the person responsible for delivering the project? If that’s me, then the project itself gets on my calendar. If it doesn’t go on the calendar, it is not getting done. The weekly check in is for all the projects other people are responsible for. As an example, you could have a company raising money or going through a big transaction. I don’t want to hound the entrepreneur or the CEO every day necessarily but at least want to stay up-to-date on a frequent basis, right? I never want these things to just go dark where you’re going “Whatever happened to that?” I want to zoom out just a little bit. Talk to me about a longer time horizon, say at a yearly level. Is there a week where you’re off meditating on top of a mountain and saying “Well, this year I need to spend more time with founders” or “This year I need to spend more time reading scientific papers” or some such allocation. And tied to that, how do you connect your goals and the firm’s goals to how you spend your time and attention? Is there a mountain top? <Laughs> There’s no mountain top dammit! Keep me off the mountaintop! No mosquitoes. No, no, none of that. So a couple of things happen. One, about every six months or so I feel overwhelmed. It all starts to kind of get away from me. And so typically about every six months, I’ll basically sit down and do a come-to-Jesus with myself. Which is “Okay, you’ve got this great system, but it’s becoming overloaded”. And “you’re saying yes to too many things and are involved in too many things”. You really have to uplevel and figure out what’s important. I usually take a good hour to look at what I’ve been doing. It’s basically figuring out the threshold for “yes” versus “no”. I try to revise that about once a year. Also about once a year, I rewrite my personal plan. I just write from scratch what I’m actually trying to do and my goals and then line up the activities that are below that. I would say a couple things about time allocation. One, it’s not spreadsheet driven. You read about these executives/CEOs having this very complex exercise and they use a spreadsheet for their calendar… Steve Ballmer famously used Excel for this calendar. Yeah, exactly. And so they’ve got all these detailed analytics and pie charts and reports and all this stuff and if you’re running a Fortune 500 company, I can maybe understand that. You’re almost a head of state at that point. You’re trying to like time-slice between so many different constituents and you’re trying to hyper optimize every 10 minutes slot. I sympathize with the people who have that challenge. That’s a level of rigor that I’m not willing to go to. I do try to have some sort of intuitive sense of what’s going on and how to rebalance. The firm is built to accomplish what I want to accomplish. And then my role here is to accomplish that within the context of the firm. And so the short answer is always the same — how do we optimize for the success of the firm? For the projects the firm is involved in, how do I optimize my contribution to that? So, you know, it’s been the same answer to the question every year for 11 years in a row and I don’t think it’ll change anytime soon. I think it’s more of trying to tune against a single goal as compared to trying to rethink the goals. Process, outcomes, and bets That’s such an interesting topic, because, as you know, there’s two schools of thought on how to set goals. Either on a personal level or at an organizational level. One is you use OKRs [objectives and key results] and metrics and you look at something very quantifiable to measure results objectively. The other school of thought is to just focus on the inputs and the process, not the actual results themselves. And to add to that, your job is unique in the sense that it has such a multi year long term feedback loop as opposed to a business unit with quarterly results. Yeah, we’re basically all about inputs. It’s basically process versus outcome. And it’s exactly for the reason you said. Venture capital is too elongated an activity. We don’t really know whether something is going to work or not work in the first five years of its life after we passed. And so it’s — okay, what do I learn? Like, what, what do I learn in the first three years when it’s not working? Because sometimes these companies really struggle for a while and then they really succeed. Sometimes it’s the opposite — they really succeed fast and then they have serious issues later. It’s really hard to get good metaphors but it’s poker, right? It’s really, really, really hard to be a good poker player. And if you’re kicking yourself every time you have a bad hand, the bad habits just simply happen. You just need to be able to have a system that lets you think through the process… “Thinking in Bets” by Annie Duke is one of the best books on this. Yeah, exactly. Michael Mauboussin has also written extensively in his books about this as a profession. The craft of investing as a process of separating process and outcome.We are almost entirely a world of trying to optimize the process. The outcomes come when they come 5, 6, 8, or 10 years out. At that point, I’m a skeptic when it comes to games where you try to look back and describe the causal relationship between the things that you did and the outcomes. It’s always uncertain and kind of sketchy. It’s really hard to derive causal relationships. Yeah, and so we really don’t spend a huge amount of time on that. What we’ve zeroed in on is — what’s the optimal way to run the process? What’s the optimal way to run the firm? What’s the optimal way to help the entrepreneur? By the way, the optimal way to help is not too much help. The optimal way is to make sure we understand what’s happening in the industry, what’s the best way to help with our network, the optimal way to help the management teams. It’s all a process. Honestly, this also goes a little bit to my psychology — I actually don’t have the gambling gene. I get no rush from the bet or the result. I sit down for one of those and nothing happens. My pulse chemistry is just flat. And then the mathematical part of my brain is like, well, the expected return for this exercise is negative, what the fuck am I doing? And so it becomes unfun in the first 10 seconds and then I just walk away. One of the things in the firm is we actually don’t celebrate our successes enough. We don’t get enough of a rush out of actually winning. We’re extremely competitive but the payoff is not the point. That’s a fascinating point because often people on the outside compare venture capitalists to gamblers when on the inside it’s incredibly different. I would never be a professional gambler but one of the things you find about professional gamblers — they may play poker at night but what they do during the day is they hang out together and they make side bets for large amounts of money. And it’s literally a side bet of sitting in a diner and betting on whether there are going to be more red cars than blue cars passing by. What they’re doing is “steeling” their own psychology to be able to pull the trigger on bets like that with a purely mathematical lens and with no emotion whatsoever. They’re trying to steel themselves to be able to be completely clinical.And so as contrast, what they then hope for that night when they sit across the table from someone is to hope they’re dealing with somebody who’s super emotional. Because the clinical person is going to just slaughter the emotional person. It’s this weird thing where it’s the kind of activity that should result in these wild highs and lows but the true pros are just indifferent. They don’t care because it’s a probabilistic outcome. That’s just part of the game and they’ll come back and they’ll probably be better the next day. I’m going to switch gears just a bit. I asked a lot of people we both know for questions for this interview. The single most common question: how do you read so much? I’ve really read all the time since I was a little kid, it’s been a lifelong thing. It’s basically trying to try to fill in all the puzzle pieces for the big discrepancies.A great term is “sense-making”. Essentially, what the hell is happening and why? The world’s an incredibly complex and erratic place and trying to figure that out is kind of a lifetime occupation. The thing I’ve tried to do the last few years is really “barbell” the inputs. I basically read things that are either up to this minute or things that are timeless– They are Lindy [Effect] safe. Yeah. I’m trying to strip out all the stuff in the middle. What I’ve discovered is the number of people who can write something in the middle zone — when they’re trying to explain something that happened last week, month, a year or even a decade — and who I trust to actually give me an objective read on the situation is just a really, really short list. There’s a handful but there aren’t very many.We have one situation currently — what’s literally happening right now [with COVID-19]. Coronavirus is one where everyday I’m looking at all the science and all the economics because these are critical issues. And I’m trying to avoid all the commentary and all of the interpretation. And then the other, as you said, there’s just a very large amount of timeless stuff that really has been proven right over time. You could spend your entire life only reading timeless works which is what smart people used to do. So how do you go from zero to one in a new space? Where do you start? Do you go breadth first or depth first? Part of being a firm is — we get to know and talk to a lot of people. So a lot of it, honestly, is face to face conversations. Often the way you learn about something is because somebody tells you about it. So, the first thing is to be alive and alert in every interaction. And then somebody gives you big things/new areas. I call them “things from the future”. Something is happening in the world. It’s only happening in one place. But..wow, it’s something that might end up actually ultimately happening everywhere. I’ll often ask those people who else I can talk to or what I can read. Every once in a while, something nice happens. When I ask what can I read, they say, “well, there really isn’t anything”. And that’s just the best case scenario because that means we might be the first to it. If it’s tech or business or finance, we basically cast inside the firm. It’s not me going off and doing a two-week deep dive but we’ll have one of the other people in the firm go off and do that work. We want to do that because it’s part of their own development and their role. It’s also an opportunity to educate us about the present. In a recent podcast, Naval Ravikant talks about how he doesn’t finish books anymore. He let go of the guilt of needing to finish books. Tyler Cowen has said something similar. Do you finish every book? Yeah, I really struggle with that. I have a whole bunch of books that I haven’t finished which I really should just toss. Patrick Collison talks about this too. The problem of having to finish every book is you’re not only spending time on books you shouldn’t be but it also causes you to stall out on reading in general. If I can’t start the next book until I finish this one, but I don’t want to read this one, I might as well go watch TV. Before you know it, you’ve stopped reading for a month and you’re asking “what have I done?!” I think that’s part of it. This moral hectoring of “don’t do that” which can only be so successful. The other technique is to read a dozen books at a time. How does that work? Do you have a stack of books next to you at all times? Are you flipping through the Kindle app on your phone? It’s a pile of physical books and then the Kindle books. And you’re reading them all at the same time. When you sit down to read, you just read the one that’s the most interesting of that pile. It turns out those are the ones that you finish. A month later, there’s a bunch that you’re theoretically reading and you’re on Chapter Three and you’re never gone back to it. That’s like having the shirt in your closet you haven’t worn in a year. It’s a signal to get rid of it. On learning and alternate viewpoints Michael Nielsen and Andy Matuschak talk about the power of ‘spaced repetition’. Some people go back and read the books just to absorb things better. Do you find yourself like going back and re-reading books at all? I aspire to be that kind of person who does that but it’s not happening. I remember instructions. I don’t remember specifics. I remember ideas really well and concepts and explanations but fail on details. I fade on people, I fade on dates, I fade on contents of specific conversations. I take a lot of notes though I’ve never referred to the notes later. I was reading this great book about memory. When you take notes, it’s actually like a double helping of memory, a double chance to remember something. The other book technique is from Chris Dixon. He thinks of chapters in books like blog posts. When he sits down to read, he goes and looks at the table of contents as a set of blog posts, Oh, those two look interesting already? And then you say — okay, I can throw the rest away. I’m not gonna read every post in the blog either, right? I’m only gonna read interesting ones– This only works for non-fiction though– Totally different process for fiction. We’ll get to fiction another day. In an earlier interview, you spoke of how you’re delighted when you’re proven wrong. So how do you seek out alternative opinions? This is like a big kind of self development. So, generally speaking, most of the people you’re around most of the time hate being told that they’re wrong, right? They absolutely hate it. It’s really an interesting question as to why that’s the case. The best explanation I’m able to come up with is: People treat their ideas like they’re their children. I have an idea the same way that I have a child and if you call my idea stupid, it’s like calling my child stupid. And then the conversation just stops. I’ve really been trying hard to do is to spend less time actually arguing with anybody. Because people really don’t want to change their mind. And so I’m trying to just literally never argue with people. However, there *is* a group of people who do love to change their mind. And interestingly, it’s the people everybody wants to hate. It’s hedge fund managers. The really good hedge fund managers seem to all have this characteristic: If you get into this heated argument with them, they’ll actually listen to what you’re saying. They won’t always change their mind but sometimes they’ll go “Oh, that’s a really good point”. And then they’ll say, “Oh, thank you” which is just really weird for it’s not usually the result of an argument. The reason they’re thanking you is because they’re gonna go back to the office next morning to reverse the trade. I think in some ways, that’s almost a function of the job where an alternate point of view is arbitrage, something they can monetize. In most typical leadership roles, your identity could be tied up, say, in the strategy that you’re running to build 1000 people on. So proving someone wrong — while the best thing for the organization — may not be great for that executive. Yes. Hedge fund people are the ultimate example because they can literally change their trades every day. They can be long a company on Tuesday and reverse that later in the week. And they love throwing away old ideas — for exactly your point — it’s going to make them money. Sometimes internally it’s my goal to have that kind of mentality but It’s very difficult. Well, if you want people who are going to tell you how wrong you are, you should get back on Twitter. On improvement and motivation Changing the topic, Tyler Cowen has this analogy he uses where he asks what’s the equivalent for knowledge workers to a pianist playing scales. Or Steph Curry doing drills. For you, especially given the long feedback loop, what do you do every single day to get better? What you’re always struggling with is to understand what’s actually happening. Like, what’s actually happening on the ground. An obvious example is if you ask an entrepreneur how the company is, they’re always going to say “great”. And that’s probably not right. You’re probably dealing with a hurricane because that’s generally the job. So, what’s actually happening inside a company? What are customers actually buying? What’s actually being adopted? What’s actually happening with the technology? What’s happening with the competition? And if you pull back to much broader issues today — what’s actually happening with coronavirus? The actual fatality rate for coronavirus is still this giant open question and there’s new research coming out every day. Despite that, a lot of people have locked into opinions that have become almost like moral positions. You want to say — “No, no, what’s *actually* happening?” We’re living a life of new science literally every day. This is what I meant earlier by being close to the ground and the previous topic of being willing to revise your views. I am a deep believer that technology really is the driver… Technology is quite literally the lever for being able to take natural resources and able to make something better out of them. One of the things I talk a lot about is this concept of “strong views weakly held”. I think in any business you do want to commit, you do want to act, you do want to bias towards action. Now, obviously, as you know, venture capitalists are on the opposite side of the spectrum from the hedge fund example since we have to wait like 10 years. We do end up much more committed to these things. You have been plugged into and focused on the future for so long. Some of it is due to the nature of your role but I believe even if you didn’t have this job, you would be doing this every day. What motivates you to go read up on a new topic every day? They’re the most interesting things in the world, right? I am a deep believer in — after learning a lot over the years about economic history and of cultural history — that technology really is the driver. There were basically millennia of just subsistence farming industry and all of a sudden, there was this vertical takeoff a few hundred years ago. And quality of life exploded around the world. Not evenly but starting in Europe and expanding out. It’s basically all technology. It’s always the printing press, it’s the internet and on and on. And you get this incredible upward trajectory. We have the potential over the course of the next century or over the next few centuries to really dramatically advance and have life be better for virtually everybody. Technology is quite literally the lever for being able to take natural resources and able to make something better out of them. And so it’s just it’s the most interesting and by far the most useful and the most beneficial thing I can think of doing. Which is a good segue. I would be remiss if I didn’t ask about this. A few weeks ago you obviously had your famous essay calling on people to build. Can you walk us through the process of writing that? Was it a Jerry Maguire-style one-night memo? Yeah, that was a single night. It was literally a single night. It started with the ponchos thing. I would describe it as a combination of “bottoms up” and “top down”. So the bottoms-up — I read the story in the Wall Street Journal about how during the height of the virus with people dying all over the place, not only did the hospitals not have enough masks for hospital workers but they also didn’t have enough medical gowns. And so the city put out a call for citizens to be able to volunteer their rain poncho so the hospital system can protect their healthcare workers. And… I couldn’t take any more. I just snapped. I literally just sat down and pounded out that essay over the next four hours, fueled by rage. What were the most surprising responses you’ve seen? The most surprising thing was it was a positive response for both sides of the political aisle. In particular, U.S. Representative Kevin McCarthy who is a sort of conservative and a leader in the House right now. He picked up and ran with it. He sent it to all the Republican Congress people that night and they were talking about it quite a bit. And then on the other hand, I got a very nice tweet from Saikat Chakrabarti who worked with U.S. Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. So you’ve got staunch conservatives and a staunch progressive, let’s say and both with an equally positive response. And that was representative of a broad base of responses. What was interesting was both sides of the political aisle found it equally compelling and that’s kind of what I was going for. Look, there are definitely a lot of conversations to be had about, like free market versus government versus this or that. But both sides know that something’s wrong, they can feel it. One of the most interesting things about the essay was you actually didn’t prescribe what to build. So now that I have you, if you could pick just one thing that you wish somebody reading this would go out and think of building — what would that be? Well, I will pick three! It’s kind of the holy trinity of our modern dilemma. It’s healthcare, it’s education, and it’s housing. It’s the big three. So basically, what’s happened is the industries in which we build like crazy, they have crashing prices. And so we build TVs like crazy, we build cars like crazy, we make food like crazy. The price on all that stuff has really fallen dramatically over the last 20 years which is an incredibly good thing for ordinary people. Falling prices are really, really good for people because you can buy more for every dollar. There are two ways here: you get paid more or everything you buy is cheaper. And people always really underestimate, I think, the benefits of everything getting cheaper. And so the stuff that we actually build is getting cheaper all the time. And that’s fantastic. The stuff we *don’t* build, and very specifically, we don’t have housing, we’re not building schools, and we’re not building anything close to the health care system that we should have — for those things the prices just are skyrocketing. That’s where you get this zero sum politics. I think people have a very keen level of awareness. They can’t put it into formal economic terms but they have a keen awareness of the markers of a modern western lifestyle. It’s things like — I want to be able to own a house, I want to live in a nice neighborhood, and I want to be able to send my kids to a really good school and I want to have really good healthcare. And those are the three things where the price levels are increasingly out of reach. However we built those systems in the past, it’s failing us. And so we need to rethink. Quite literally, it’s like, okay, where are the schools? Where are the hospitals? Where are the houses? This interview originally appeared on The Observer Effect. screenshot images: Marc Andreessen"}
{"text":"The era of Artificial Intelligence is here, and boy are people freaking out. Fortunately, I am here to bring the good news: AI will not destroy the world, and in fact may save it. First, a short description of what AI is: The application of mathematics and software code to teach computers how to understand, synthesize, and generate knowledge in ways similar to how people do it. AI is a computer program like any other – it runs, takes input, processes, and generates output. AI’s output is useful across a wide range of fields, ranging from coding to medicine to law to the creative arts. It is owned by people and controlled by people, like any other technology. A shorter description of what AI isn’t: Killer software and robots that will spring to life and decide to murder the human race or otherwise ruin everything, like you see in the movies. An even shorter description of what AI could be: A way to make everything we care about better. Why AI Can Make Everything We Care About Better The most validated core conclusion of social science across many decades and thousands of studies is that human intelligence makes a very broad range of life outcomes better. Smarter people have better outcomes in almost every domain of activity: academic achievement, job performance, occupational status, income, creativity, physical health, longevity, learning new skills, managing complex tasks, leadership, entrepreneurial success, conflict resolution, reading comprehension, financial decision making, understanding others’ perspectives, creative arts, parenting outcomes, and life satisfaction. Further, human intelligence is the lever that we have used for millennia to create the world we live in today: science, technology, math, physics, chemistry, medicine, energy, construction, transportation, communication, art, music, culture, philosophy, ethics, morality. Without the application of intelligence on all these domains, we would all still be living in mud huts, scratching out a meager existence of subsistence farming. Instead we have used our intelligence to raise our standard of living on the order of 10,000X over the last 4,000 years. What AI offers us is the opportunity to profoundly augment human intelligence to make all of these outcomes of intelligence – and many others, from the creation of new medicines to ways to solve climate change to technologies to reach the stars – much, much better from here. AI augmentation of human intelligence has already started – AI is already around us in the form of computer control systems of many kinds, is now rapidly escalating with AI Large Language Models like ChatGPT, and will accelerate very quickly from here – if we let it. In our new era of AI: Every child will have an AI tutor that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, infinitely helpful. The AI tutor will be by each child’s side every step of their development, helping them maximize their potential with the machine version of infinite love. Every person will have an AI assistant/coach/mentor/trainer/advisor/therapist that is infinitely patient, infinitely compassionate, infinitely knowledgeable, and infinitely helpful. The AI assistant will be present through all of life’s opportunities and challenges, maximizing every person’s outcomes. Every scientist will have an AI assistant/collaborator/partner that will greatly expand their scope of scientific research and achievement. Every artist, every engineer, every businessperson, every doctor, every caregiver will have the same in their worlds. Every leader of people – CEO, government official, nonprofit president, athletic coach, teacher – will have the same. The magnification effects of better decisions by leaders across the people they lead are enormous, so this intelligence augmentation may be the most important of all. Productivity growth throughout the economy will accelerate dramatically, driving economic growth, creation of new industries, creation of new jobs, and wage growth, and resulting in a new era of heightened material prosperity across the planet. Scientific breakthroughs and new technologies and medicines will dramatically expand, as AI helps us further decode the laws of nature and harvest them for our benefit. The creative arts will enter a golden age, as AI-augmented artists, musicians, writers, and filmmakers gain the ability to realize their visions far faster and at greater scale than ever before. I even think AI is going to improve warfare, when it has to happen, by reducing wartime death rates dramatically. Every war is characterized by terrible decisions made under intense pressure and with sharply limited information by very limited human leaders. Now, military commanders and political leaders will have AI advisors that will help them make much better strategic and tactical decisions, minimizing risk, error, and unnecessary bloodshed. In short, anything that people do with their natural intelligence today can be done much better with AI, and we will be able to take on new challenges that have been impossible to tackle without AI, from curing all diseases to achieving interstellar travel. And this isn’t just about intelligence! Perhaps the most underestimated quality of AI is how humanizing it can be. AI art gives people who otherwise lack technical skills the freedom to create and share their artistic ideas. Talking to an empathetic AI friend really does improve their ability to handle adversity. And AI medical chatbots are already more empathetic than their human counterparts. Rather than making the world harsher and more mechanistic, infinitely patient and sympathetic AI will make the world warmer and nicer. The stakes here are high. The opportunities are profound. AI is quite possibly the most important – and best – thing our civilization has ever created, certainly on par with electricity and microchips, and probably beyond those. The development and proliferation of AI – far from a risk that we should fear – is a moral obligation that we have to ourselves, to our children, and to our future. We should be living in a much better world with AI, and now we can. TABLE OF CONTENTSSo Why The Panic? In contrast to this positive view, the public conversation about AI is presently shot through with hysterical fear and paranoia. We hear claims that AI will variously kill us all, ruin our society, take all our jobs, cause crippling inequality, and enable bad people to do awful things. What explains this divergence in potential outcomes from near utopia to horrifying dystopia? Historically, every new technology that matters, from electric lighting to automobiles to radio to the Internet, has sparked a moral panic – a social contagion that convinces people the new technology is going to destroy the world, or society, or both. The fine folks at Pessimists Archive have documented these technology-driven moral panics over the decades; their history makes the pattern vividly clear. It turns out this present panic is not even the first for AI. Now, it is certainly the case that many new technologies have led to bad outcomes – often the same technologies that have been otherwise enormously beneficial to our welfare. So it’s not that the mere existence of a moral panic means there is nothing to be concerned about. But a moral panic is by its very nature irrational – it takes what may be a legitimate concern and inflates it into a level of hysteria that ironically makes it harder to confront actually serious concerns. And wow do we have a full-blown moral panic about AI right now. This moral panic is already being used as a motivating force by a variety of actors to demand policy action – new AI restrictions, regulations, and laws. These actors, who are making extremely dramatic public statements about the dangers of AI – feeding on and further inflaming moral panic – all present themselves as selfless champions of the public good. And are they right or wrong? TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Baptists And Bootleggers Of AI Economists have observed a longstanding pattern in reform movements of this kind. The actors within movements like these fall into two categories – “Baptists” and “Bootleggers” – drawing on the historical example of the prohibition of alcohol in the United States in the 1920’s: “Baptists” are the true believer social reformers who legitimately feel – deeply and emotionally, if not rationally – that new restrictions, regulations, and laws are required to prevent societal disaster. For alcohol prohibition, these actors were often literally devout Christians who felt that alcohol was destroying the moral fabric of society. For AI risk, these actors are true believers that AI presents one or another existential risks – strap them to a polygraph, they really mean it. “Bootleggers” are the self-interested opportunists who stand to financially profit by the imposition of new restrictions, regulations, and laws that insulate them from competitors. For alcohol prohibition, these were the literal bootleggers who made a fortune selling illicit alcohol to Americans when legitimate alcohol sales were banned. For AI risk, these are CEOs who stand to make more money if regulatory barriers are erected that form a cartel of government-blessed AI vendors protected from new startup and open source competition – the software version of “too big to fail” banks. A cynic would suggest that some of the apparent Baptists are also Bootleggers – specifically the ones paid to attack AI by their universities, think tanks, activist groups, and media outlets. If you are paid a salary or receive grants to foster AI panic…you are probably a Bootlegger. The problem with the Bootleggers is that they win. The Baptists are naive ideologues, the Bootleggers are cynical operators, and so the result of reform movements like these is often that the Bootleggers get what they want – regulatory capture, insulation from competition, the formation of a cartel – and the Baptists are left wondering where their drive for social improvement went so wrong. We just lived through a stunning example of this – banking reform after the 2008 global financial crisis. The Baptists told us that we needed new laws and regulations to break up the “too big to fail” banks to prevent such a crisis from ever happening again. So Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, which was marketed as satisfying the Baptists’ goal, but in reality was coopted by the Bootleggers – the big banks. The result is that the same banks that were “too big to fail” in 2008 are much, much larger now. So in practice, even when the Baptists are genuine – and even when the Baptists are right – they are used as cover by manipulative and venal Bootleggers to benefit themselves. And this is what is happening in the drive for AI regulation right now. However, it isn’t sufficient to simply identify the actors and impugn their motives. We should consider the arguments of both the Baptists and the Bootleggers on their merits. TABLE OF CONTENTSAI Risk #1: Will AI Kill Us All? The first and original AI doomer risk is that AI will decide to literally kill humanity. The fear that technology of our own creation will rise up and destroy us is deeply coded into our culture. The Greeks expressed this fear in the Prometheus Myth – Prometheus brought the destructive power of fire, and more generally technology (“techne”), to man, for which Prometheus was condemned to perpetual torture by the gods. Later, Mary Shelley gave us moderns our own version of this myth in her novel Frankenstein, or, The Modern Prometheus, in which we develop the technology for eternal life, which then rises up and seeks to destroy us. And of course, no AI panic newspaper story is complete without a still image of a gleaming red-eyed killer robot from James Cameron’s Terminator films. The presumed evolutionary purpose of this mythology is to motivate us to seriously consider potential risks of new technologies – fire, after all, can indeed be used to burn down entire cities. But just as fire was also the foundation of modern civilization as used to keep us warm and safe in a cold and hostile world, this mythology ignores the far greater upside of most – all? – new technologies, and in practice inflames destructive emotion rather than reasoned analysis. Just because premodern man freaked out like this doesn’t mean we have to; we can apply rationality instead. My view is that the idea that AI will decide to literally kill humanity is a profound category error. AI is not a living being that has been primed by billions of years of evolution to participate in the battle for the survival of the fittest, as animals are, and as we are. It is math – code – computers, built by people, owned by people, used by people, controlled by people. The idea that it will at some point develop a mind of its own and decide that it has motivations that lead it to try to kill us is a superstitious handwave. In short, AI doesn’t want, it doesn’t have goals, it doesn’t want to kill you, because it’s not alive. And AI is a machine – is not going to come alive any more than your toaster will. Now, obviously, there are true believers in killer AI – Baptists – who are gaining a suddenly stratospheric amount of media coverage for their terrifying warnings, some of whom claim to have been studying the topic for decades and say they are now scared out of their minds by what they have learned. Some of these true believers are even actual innovators of the technology. These actors are arguing for a variety of bizarre and extreme restrictions on AI ranging from a ban on AI development, all the way up to military airstrikes on datacenters and nuclear war. They argue that because people like me cannot rule out future catastrophic consequences of AI, that we must assume a precautionary stance that may require large amounts of physical violence and death in order to prevent potential existential risk. My response is that their position is non-scientific – What is the testable hypothesis? What would falsify the hypothesis? How do we know when we are getting into a danger zone? These questions go mainly unanswered apart from “You can’t prove it won’t happen!” In fact, these Baptists’ position is so non-scientific and so extreme – a conspiracy theory about math and code – and is already calling for physical violence, that I will do something I would normally not do and question their motives as well. Specifically, I think three things are going on: First, recall that John Von Neumann responded to Robert Oppenheimer’s famous hand-wringing about his role creating nuclear weapons – which helped end World War II and prevent World War III – with, “Some people confess guilt to claim credit for the sin.” What is the most dramatic way one can claim credit for the importance of one’s work without sounding overtly boastful? This explains the mismatch between the words and actions of the Baptists who are actually building and funding AI – watch their actions, not their words. (Truman was harsher after meeting with Oppenheimer: “Don’t let that crybaby in here again.”) Second, some of the Baptists are actually Bootleggers. There is a whole profession of “AI safety expert”, “AI ethicist”, “AI risk researcher”. They are paid to be doomers, and their statements should be processed appropriately. Third, California is justifiably famous for our many thousands of cults, from EST to the Peoples Temple, from Heaven’s Gate to the Manson Family. Many, although not all, of these cults are harmless, and maybe even serve a purpose for alienated people who find homes in them. But some are very dangerous indeed, and cults have a notoriously hard time straddling the line that ultimately leads to violence and death. And the reality, which is obvious to everyone in the Bay Area but probably not outside of it, is that “AI risk” has developed into a cult, which has suddenly emerged into the daylight of global press attention and the public conversation. This cult has pulled in not just fringe characters, but also some actual industry experts and a not small number of wealthy donors – including, until recently, Sam Bankman-Fried. And it’s developed a full panoply of cult behaviors and beliefs. This cult is why there are a set of AI risk doomers who sound so extreme – it’s not that they actually have secret knowledge that make their extremism logical, it’s that they’ve whipped themselves into a frenzy and really are…extremely extreme. It turns out that this type of cult isn’t new – there is a longstanding Western tradition of millenarianism, which generates apocalypse cults. The AI risk cult has all the hallmarks of a millenarian apocalypse cult. From Wikipedia, with additions by me: “Millenarianism is the belief by a group or movement [AI risk doomers] in a coming fundamental transformation of society [the arrival of AI], after which all things will be changed [AI utopia, dystopia, and/or end of the world]. Only dramatic events [AI bans, airstrikes on datacenters, nuclear strikes on unregulated AI] are seen as able to change the world [prevent AI] and the change is anticipated to be brought about, or survived, by a group of the devout and dedicated. In most millenarian scenarios, the disaster or battle to come [AI apocalypse, or its prevention] will be followed by a new, purified world [AI bans] in which the believers will be rewarded [or at least acknowledged to have been correct all along].” This apocalypse cult pattern is so obvious that I am surprised more people don’t see it. Don’t get me wrong, cults are fun to hear about, their written material is often creative and fascinating, and their members are engaging at dinner parties and on TV. But their extreme beliefs should not determine the future of laws and society – obviously not. TABLE OF CONTENTSAI Risk #2: Will AI Ruin Our Society? The second widely mooted AI risk is that AI will ruin our society, by generating outputs that will be so “harmful”, to use the nomenclature of this kind of doomer, as to cause profound damage to humanity, even if we’re not literally killed. Short version: If the murder robots don’t get us, the hate speech and misinformation will. This is a relatively recent doomer concern that branched off from and somewhat took over the “AI risk” movement that I described above. In fact, the terminology of AI risk recently changed from “AI safety” – the term used by people who are worried that AI would literally kill us – to “AI alignment” – the term used by people who are worried about societal “harms”. The original AI safety people are frustrated by this shift, although they don’t know how to put it back in the box – they now advocate that the actual AI risk topic be renamed “AI notkilleveryoneism”, which has not yet been widely adopted but is at least clear. The tipoff to the nature of the AI societal risk claim is its own term, “AI alignment”. Alignment with what? Human values. Whose human values? Ah, that’s where things get tricky. As it happens, I have had a front row seat to an analogous situation – the social media “trust and safety” wars. As is now obvious, social media services have been under massive pressure from governments and activists to ban, restrict, censor, and otherwise suppress a wide range of content for many years. And the same concerns of “hate speech” (and its mathematical counterpart, “algorithmic bias”) and “misinformation” are being directly transferred from the social media context to the new frontier of “AI alignment”. My big learnings from the social media wars are: On the one hand, there is no absolutist free speech position. First, every country, including the United States, makes at least some content illegal. Second, there are certain kinds of content, like child pornography and incitements to real world violence, that are nearly universally agreed to be off limits – legal or not – by virtually every society. So any technological platform that facilitates or generates content – speech – is going to have some restrictions. On the other hand, the slippery slope is not a fallacy, it’s an inevitability. Once a framework for restricting even egregiously terrible content is in place – for example, for hate speech, a specific hurtful word, or for misinformation, obviously false claims like “the Pope is dead” – a shockingly broad range of government agencies and activist pressure groups and nongovernmental entities will kick into gear and demand ever greater levels of censorship and suppression of whatever speech they view as threatening to society and/or their own personal preferences. They will do this up to and including in ways that are nakedly felony crimes. This cycle in practice can run apparently forever, with the enthusiastic support of authoritarian hall monitors installed throughout our elite power structures. This has been cascading for a decade in social media and with only certain exceptions continues to get more fervent all the time. And so this is the dynamic that has formed around “AI alignment” now. Its proponents claim the wisdom to engineer AI-generated speech and thought that are good for society, and to ban AI-generated speech and thoughts that are bad for society. Its opponents claim that the thought police are breathtakingly arrogant and presumptuous – and often outright criminal, at least in the US – and in fact are seeking to become a new kind of fused government-corporate-academic authoritarian speech dictatorship ripped straight from the pages of George Orwell’s 1984. As the proponents of both “trust and safety” and “AI alignment” are clustered into the very narrow slice of the global population that characterizes the American coastal elites – which includes many of the people who work in and write about the tech industry – many of my readers will find yourselves primed to argue that dramatic restrictions on AI output are required to avoid destroying society. I will not attempt to talk you out of this now, I will simply state that this is the nature of the demand, and that most people in the world neither agree with your ideology nor want to see you win. If you don’t agree with the prevailing niche morality that is being imposed on both social media and AI via ever-intensifying speech codes, you should also realize that the fight over what AI is allowed to say/generate will be even more important – by a lot – than the fight over social media censorship. AI is highly likely to be the control layer for everything in the world. How it is allowed to operate is going to matter perhaps more than anything else has ever mattered. You should be aware of how a small and isolated coterie of partisan social engineers are trying to determine that right now, under cover of the age-old claim that they are protecting you. In short, don’t let the thought police suppress AI. TABLE OF CONTENTSAI Risk #3: Will AI Take All Our Jobs? The fear of job loss due variously to mechanization, automation, computerization, or AI has been a recurring panic for hundreds of years, since the original onset of machinery such as the mechanical loom. Even though every new major technology has led to more jobs at higher wages throughout history, each wave of this panic is accompanied by claims that “this time is different” – this is the time it will finally happen, this is the technology that will finally deliver the hammer blow to human labor. And yet, it never happens. We’ve been through two such technology-driven unemployment panic cycles in our recent past – the outsourcing panic of the 2000’s, and the automation panic of the 2010’s. Notwithstanding many talking heads, pundits, and even tech industry executives pounding the table throughout both decades that mass unemployment was near, by late 2019 – right before the onset of COVID – the world had more jobs at higher wages than ever in history. Nevertheless this mistaken idea will not die. And sure enough, it’s back. This time, we finally have the technology that’s going to take all the jobs and render human workers superfluous – real AI. Surely this time history won’t repeat, and AI will cause mass unemployment – and not rapid economic, job, and wage growth – right? No, that’s not going to happen – and in fact AI, if allowed to develop and proliferate throughout the economy, may cause the most dramatic and sustained economic boom of all time, with correspondingly record job and wage growth – the exact opposite of the fear. And here’s why. The core mistake the automation-kills-jobs doomers keep making is called the Lump Of Labor Fallacy. This fallacy is the incorrect notion that there is a fixed amount of labor to be done in the economy at any given time, and either machines do it or people do it – and if machines do it, there will be no work for people to do. The Lump Of Labor Fallacy flows naturally from naive intuition, but naive intuition here is wrong. When technology is applied to production, we get productivity growth – an increase in output generated by a reduction in inputs. The result is lower prices for goods and services. As prices for goods and services fall, we pay less for them, meaning that we now have extra spending power with which to buy other things. This increases demand in the economy, which drives the creation of new production – including new products and new industries – which then creates new jobs for the people who were replaced by machines in prior jobs. The result is a larger economy with higher material prosperity, more industries, more products, and more jobs. But the good news doesn’t stop there. We also get higher wages. This is because, at the level of the individual worker, the marketplace sets compensation as a function of the marginal productivity of the worker. A worker in a technology-infused business will be more productive than a worker in a traditional business. The employer will either pay that worker more money as he is now more productive, or another employer will, purely out of self interest. The result is that technology introduced into an industry generally not only increases the number of jobs in the industry but also raises wages. To summarize, technology empowers people to be more productive. This causes the prices for existing goods and services to fall, and for wages to rise. This in turn causes economic growth and job growth, while motivating the creation of new jobs and new industries. If a market economy is allowed to function normally and if technology is allowed to be introduced freely, this is a perpetual upward cycle that never ends. For, as Milton Friedman observed, “Human wants and needs are endless” – we always want more than we have. A technology-infused market economy is the way we get closer to delivering everything everyone could conceivably want, but never all the way there. And that is why technology doesn’t destroy jobs and never will. These are such mindblowing ideas for people who have not been exposed to them that it may take you some time to wrap your head around them. But I swear I’m not making them up – in fact you can read all about them in standard economics textbooks. I recommend the chapter The Curse of Machinery in Henry Hazlitt’s Economics In One Lesson, and Frederic Bastiat’s satirical Candlemaker’s Petition to blot out the sun due to its unfair competition with the lighting industry, here modernized for our times. But this time is different, you’re thinking. This time, with AI, we have the technology that can replace ALL human labor. But, using the principles I described above, think of what it would mean for literally all existing human labor to be replaced by machines. It would mean a takeoff rate of economic productivity growth that would be absolutely stratospheric, far beyond any historical precedent. Prices of existing goods and services would drop across the board to virtually zero. Consumer welfare would skyrocket. Consumer spending power would skyrocket. New demand in the economy would explode. Entrepreneurs would create dizzying arrays of new industries, products, and services, and employ as many people and AI as they could as fast as possible to meet all the new demand. Suppose AI once again replaces that labor? The cycle would repeat, driving consumer welfare, economic growth, and job and wage growth even higher. It would be a straight spiral up to a material utopia that neither Adam Smith or Karl Marx ever dared dream of. We should be so lucky. TABLE OF CONTENTSAI Risk #4 Will AI Lead To Crippling Inequality? Speaking of Karl Marx, the concern about AI taking jobs segues directly into the next claimed AI risk, which is, OK, Marc, suppose AI does take all the jobs, either for bad or for good. Won’t that result in massive and crippling wealth inequality, as the owners of AI reap all the economic rewards and regular people get nothing? As it happens, this was a central claim of Marxism, that the owners of the means of production – the bourgeoisie – would inevitably steal all societal wealth from the people who do the actual  work – the proletariat. This is another fallacy that simply will not die no matter how often it’s disproved by reality. But let’s drive a stake through its heart anyway. The flaw in this theory is that, as the owner of a piece of technology, it’s not in your own interest to keep it to yourself – in fact the opposite, it’s in your own interest to sell it to as many customers as possible. The largest market in the world for any product is the entire world, all 8 billion of us. And so in reality, every new technology – even ones that start by selling to the rarefied air of high-paying big companies or wealthy consumers – rapidly proliferates until it’s in the hands of the largest possible mass market, ultimately everyone on the planet. The classic example of this was Elon Musk’s so-called “secret plan” – which he naturally published openly – for Tesla in 2006: Step 1, Build [expensive] sports car Step 2, Use that money to build an affordable car Step 3, Use that money to build an even more affordable car …which is of course exactly what he’s done, becoming the richest man in the world as a result. That last point is key. Would Elon be even richer if he only sold cars to rich people today? No. Would he be even richer than that if he only made cars for himself? Of course not. No, he maximizes his own profit by selling to the largest possible market, the world. In short, everyone gets the thing – as we saw in the past with not just cars but also electricity, radio, computers, the Internet, mobile phones, and search engines. The makers of such technologies are highly motivated to drive down their prices until everyone on the planet can afford them. This is precisely what is already happening in AI – it’s why you can use state of the art generative AI not just at low cost but even for free today in the form of Microsoft Bing and Google Bard – and it is what will continue to happen. Not because such vendors are foolish or generous but precisely because they are greedy – they want to maximize the size of their market, which maximizes their profits. So what happens is the opposite of technology driving centralization of wealth – individual customers of the technology, ultimately including everyone on the planet, are empowered instead, and capture most of the generated value. As with prior technologies, the companies that build AI – assuming they have to function in a free market – will compete furiously to make this happen. Marx was wrong then, and he’s wrong now. This is not to say that inequality is not an issue in our society. It is, it’s just not being driven by technology, it’s being driven by the reverse, by the sectors of the economy that are the most resistant to new technology, that have the most government intervention to prevent the adoption of new technology like AI – specifically housing, education, and health care. The actual risk of AI and inequality is not that AI will cause more inequality but rather that we will not allow AI to be used to reduce inequality. AI Risk #5: Will AI Lead to Bad People Doing Bad Things? So far I have explained why four of the five most often proposed risks of AI are not actually real – AI will not come to life and kill us, AI will not ruin our society, AI will not cause mass unemployment, and AI will not cause an ruinous increase in inequality. But now let’s address the fifth, the one I actually agree with: AI will make it easier for bad people to do bad things. In some sense this is a tautology. Technology is a tool. Tools, starting with fire and rocks, can be used to do good things – cook food and build houses – and bad things – burn people and bludgeon people. Any technology can be used for good or bad. Fair enough. And AI will make it easier for criminals, terrorists, and hostile governments to do bad things, no question. This causes some people to propose, well, in that case, let’s not take the risk, let’s ban AI now before this can happen. Unfortunately, AI is not some esoteric physical material that is hard to come by, like plutonium. It’s the opposite, it’s the easiest material in the world to come by – math and code. The AI cat is obviously already out of the bag. You can learn how to build AI from thousands of free online courses, books, papers, and videos, and there are outstanding open source implementations proliferating by the day. AI is like air – it will be everywhere. The level of totalitarian oppression that would be required to arrest that would be so draconian – a world government monitoring and controlling all computers? jackbooted thugs in black helicopters seizing rogue GPUs? – that we would not have a society left to protect. So instead, there are two very straightforward ways to address the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI, and these are precisely what we should focus on. First, we have laws on the books to criminalize most of the bad things that anyone is going to do with AI. Hack into the Pentagon? That’s a crime. Steal money from a bank? That’s a crime. Create a bioweapon? That’s a crime. Commit a terrorist act? That’s a crime. We can simply focus on preventing those crimes when we can, and prosecuting them when we cannot. We don’t even need new laws – I’m not aware of a single actual bad use for AI that’s been proposed that’s not already illegal. And if a new bad use is identified, we ban that use. QED. But you’ll notice what I slipped in there – I said we should focus first on preventing AI-assisted crimes before they happen – wouldn’t such prevention mean banning AI? Well, there’s another way to prevent such actions, and that’s by using AI as a defensive tool. The same capabilities that make AI dangerous in the hands of bad guys with bad goals make it powerful in the hands of good guys with good goals – specifically the good guys whose job it is to prevent bad things from happening. For example, if you are worried about AI generating fake people and fake videos, the answer is to build new systems where people can verify themselves and real content via cryptographic signatures. Digital creation and alteration of both real and fake content was already here before AI; the answer is not to ban word processors and Photoshop – or AI – but to use technology to build a system that actually solves the problem. And so, second, let’s mount major efforts to use AI for good, legitimate, defensive purposes. Let’s put AI to work in cyberdefense, in biological defense, in hunting terrorists, and in everything else that we do to keep ourselves, our communities, and our nation safe. There are already many smart people in and out of government doing exactly this, of course – but if we apply all of the effort and brainpower that’s currently fixated on the futile prospect of banning AI to using AI to protect against bad people doing bad things, I think there’s no question a world infused with AI will be much safer than the world we live in today. TABLE OF CONTENTSThe Actual Risk Of Not Pursuing AI With Maximum Force And Speed There is one final, and real, AI risk that is probably the scariest at all: AI isn’t just being developed in the relatively free societies of the West, it is also being developed by the Communist Party of the People’s Republic of China. China has a vastly different vision for AI than we do – they view it as a mechanism for authoritarian population control, full stop. They are not even being secretive about this, they are very clear about it, and they are already pursuing their agenda. And they do not intend to limit their AI strategy to China – they intend to proliferate it all across the world, everywhere they are powering 5G networks, everywhere they are loaning Belt And Road money, everywhere they are providing friendly consumer apps like Tiktok that serve as front ends to their centralized command and control AI. The single greatest risk of AI is that China wins global AI dominance and we – the United States and the West – do not. I propose a simple strategy for what to do about this – in fact, the same strategy President Ronald Reagan used to win the first Cold War with the Soviet Union. Rather than allowing ungrounded panics around killer AI, “harmful” AI, job-destroying AI, and inequality-generating AI to put us on our back feet, we in the United States and the West should lean into AI as hard as we possibly can. We should seek to win the race to global AI technological superiority and ensure that China does not. In the process, we should drive AI into our economy and society as fast and hard as we possibly can, in order to maximize its gains for economic productivity and human potential. This is the best way both to offset the real AI risks and to ensure that our way of life is not displaced by the much darker Chinese vision. TABLE OF CONTENTSWhat Is To Be Done? I propose a simple plan: Big AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can – but not allowed to achieve regulatory capture, not allowed to establish a government-protect cartel that is insulated from market competition due to incorrect claims of AI risk. This will maximize the technological and societal payoff from the amazing capabilities of these companies, which are jewels of modern capitalism. Startup AI companies should be allowed to build AI as fast and aggressively as they can. They should neither confront government-granted protection of big companies, nor should they receive government assistance. They should simply be allowed to compete. If and as startups don’t succeed, their presence in the market will also continuously motivate big companies to be their best – our economies and societies win either way. Open source AI should be allowed to freely proliferate and compete with both big AI companies and startups. There should be no regulatory barriers to open source whatsoever. Even when open source does not beat companies, its widespread availability is a boon to students all over the world who want to learn how to build and use AI to become part of the technological future, and will ensure that AI is available to everyone who can benefit from it no matter who they are or how much money they have. To offset the risk of bad people doing bad things with AI, governments working in partnership with the private sector should vigorously engage in each area of potential risk to use AI to maximize society’s defensive capabilities. This shouldn’t be limited to AI-enabled risks but also more general problems such as malnutrition, disease, and climate. AI can be an incredibly powerful tool for solving problems, and we should embrace it as such. To prevent the risk of China achieving global AI dominance, we should use the full power of our private sector, our scientific establishment, and our governments in concert to drive American and Western AI to absolute global dominance, including ultimately inside China itself. We win, they lose. And that is how we use AI to save the world. I close with two simple statements. The development of AI started in the 1940’s, simultaneous with the invention of the computer. The first scientific paper on neural networks – the architecture of the AI we have today – was published in 1943. Entire generations of AI scientists over the last 80 years were born, went to school, worked, and in many cases passed away without seeing the payoff that we are receiving now. They are legends, every one. Today, growing legions of engineers – many of whom are young and may have had grandparents or even great-grandparents involved in the creation of the ideas behind AI – are working to make AI a reality, against a wall of fear-mongering and doomerism that is attempting to paint them as reckless villains. I do not believe they are reckless or villains. They are heroes, every one. My firm and I are thrilled to back as many of them as we can, and we will stand alongside them and their work 100%."}
{"text":"Artificial intelligence is the most consequential innovation we have seen in a generation, with the transformative power to address society’s most complex problems and create a whole new economy—much like what we saw with the advent of the printing press, electricity, and the internet. It is a moment so big that it would be shortsighted for us to ignore the power of collaborating across the AI ecosystem—and the possibilities and potential that stand to be born from it. That is what brings us together—a shared understanding of what the stakes of this moment require and the role innovators big and small play in expanding opportunity and maintaining economic competitiveness. Our two firms believe that Little Tech and Big Tech can work successfully together, both to build a broader innovation ecosystem and collaborate on public policy initiatives. Our two companies might not agree on everything, but this is not about our differences. It is about jointly recognizing that the policy choices—or missteps—we make now will determine whether the U.S. can continue our long and proud history of fostering innovation and seeing startups, small businesses, and entrepreneurs succeed. After all, we both know a thing or two about the little guy working to achieve greatness from their garage. That is the story of Microsoft and the mission of a16z. We both firmly believe that when it comes to AI, the opportunities are enormous and that our way forward to building a new AI economy is by spurring innovation and fostering competition. The best way to encourage innovation while also ensuring safety and security is through a variety of responsible market-based approaches and business models, including open-source AI. Open-source models have contributed indispensably to major advances in technology and research for decades, often by reducing or eliminating power imbalances between major institutions and scrappy upstarts, allowing the academic and startup community to have greater access and build upon existing knowledge while also offering real-time peer review. a16z views competition and innovation through the lens of Little Tech: small businesses and startups. a16z published its policy agenda for Little Tech in July, proposing a series of policy ideas to promote AI innovation through regulation that creates an even playing field across all industries. The goal of the Little Tech Agenda is to ensure that public policy supports startups, providing entrepreneurs the “freedom to research, to invent, to create jobs, to build the future.” Microsoft is committed to making large-scale AI infrastructure investments that only a Big Tech company with our scope and size can afford, creating a platform that is affordable and easily accessible to everyone, including startups and small firms. These infrastructure investments are essential to creating opportunities for new businesses to experiment and grow in the AI economy. In February of this year, Microsoft announced a set of principles (referred to as the AI Access Principles) to govern its operations and deliver on this commitment. One primary tenet that informs Microsoft’s AI Access Principles is the critical need to “spur innovation and competition across the new AI economy.” Together, we believe in a competitive and broad ecosystem that harnesses the potential of academic research and business innovation, including a vital role for open-source innovation that will unleash the ideas of tomorrow to make life better for everyone and our country more secure and prosperous. By coming together, we hope to drive innovation and creativity and further live up to our highest aspirations and ideals that have defined the U.S. for generations. These are the policy objectives to get us there. The policy opportunity for AI startups Microsoft and a16z jointly recognize an opportunity to advance public policy that will allow American entrepreneurs and innovators to do what they do best—build new tools and businesses that solve problems, create new jobs and opportunities, and enable startups to flourish. Ensuring that companies large and small have a seat at the table will better serve the public and will accelerate American innovation. We offer the following policy ideas for AI startups so they can thrive, collaborate, and compete. Regulation that promotes opportunity for U.S. businesses: U.S. AI laws and regulations should support the global success and proliferation of U.S. technology companies by promoting access and opportunity. This can be done by leveraging a science and standards-based approach that recognizes regulatory frameworks that focus on the application and misuse of technology. Regulation should be implemented only if its benefits outweigh its costs. In accounting for costs, policymakers should include an assessment of possible costs associated with unnecessary bureaucratic burdens to startups. As the new global competition in AI evolves, laws and regulations that mitigate AI harm should focus on the risk of bad actors misusing AI and aim to avoid creating new barriers to business formation, growth, and innovation. Competition and choice: enabling choice and broad access fosters AI innovation and competition. Regulators should not only permit providers to offer a broad array of models—proprietary and open source, large and small—but should permit developers and startups the flexibility to choose which AI models to use wherever they are building solutions and not tilt the playing field to advantage any one platform. Developers should have the freedom to choose how to distribute and sell their AI models, tools, and applications for deployment to customers. Open-source innovation: open-source software provides immense value to our economy by catalyzing the innovation ecosystem. It allows tech companies big and small the ability to build the next innovation quickly and gives them a wide array of tools for developing software safely, securely, and competitively. We believe the same is true for open-source AI models. They increase choice and allow startups to more easily develop fine-tuned systems and applications. The free availability and performance of these models allow startups to access, use, and benefit from AI by modifying it to suit their conditions and diverse needs. They also offer the promise of safety and security benefits, since they can be more widely scrutinized for vulnerabilities. Regulators and decision-makers should embrace a regulatory framework that protects open source and secures the ability of entrepreneurs, startups, and companies to create, build, transform and win the future. Open data commons: data is a critical input for all AI developers. There is a role for government to enable and craft policies that support a thriving and growing ecosystem of data around the globe through Open Data Commons—pools of accessible data that would be managed in the public’s interest. Governments should participate and lead this effort by releasing data sets in ways that are useful for AI cultural institutions and libraries. Governments should ensure that startups can easily access these data pools. The right to learn: copyright law is designed to promote the progress of science and useful arts by extending protections to publishers and authors to encourage them to bring new works and knowledge to the public, but not at the expense of the public’s right to learn from these works. Copyright law should not be co-opted to imply that machines should be prevented from using data—the foundation of AI—to learn in the same way as people. Knowledge and unprotected facts, regardless of whether contained in protected subject matter, should remain free and accessible. Invest in AI: the U.S. government should invest in AI to accelerate American innovation, strengthen our national security, and create economic opportunity. As part of this investment strategy, the government should examine its procurement practices to enable more startups to sell technology to the government. Help people thrive in an AI-enabled world: building a new AI economy that supports startups, and American entrepreneurship will require public policy that cultivates technical talent and engages digital citizens. To that end, policy should fund digital literacy programs that help people understand how to use AI tools to create and access information. It should also support workforce skill development and workforce retraining programs to help people secure jobs in an AI-driven economy. We obviously live in a tumultuous time, often characterized by disagreements among people and groups. But as in every age, we need to seize opportunities to find common ground. The United States has built a tech ecosystem that has helped fuel the nation’s economic growth for more than half a century. As reflected here, we believe that Little Tech and Big Tech can contribute even more in the decades ahead by coming together. We can build on each other’s strengths, and we can advocate together for public policies that will serve innovation and the nation’s broader interests."}
{"text":"Little Tech is our term for tech startups, as contrasted to Big Tech incumbents. Little Tech has run independent of politics for our entire careers. But, as the old Soviet joke goes, “You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you.” We believe bad government policies are now the #1 threat to Little Tech. We believe American technology supremacy, and the critical role that Little Tech startups play in ensuring that supremacy, is a first class political issue on par with any other. The time has come to stand up for Little Tech. Our political efforts as a firm are entirely focused on defending Little Tech. We do not engage in political fights outside of issues directly relevant to Little Tech. But we will fight for Little Tech – for the freedom to research, to invent, to create jobs, to build the future – with all of our resources. We find there are three kinds of politicians: Those who support Little Tech. We support them. Those who oppose Little Tech. We oppose them. Those who are somewhere in the middle – they want to be supportive, but they have concerns. We work with them in good faith. We support or oppose politicians regardless of party and regardless of their positions on other issues. We are in this for the long haul. America led the 20th Century because we are preeminent in three dimensions: Technology – America drove the Second Industrial Revolution through the 1930’s, and then the Computer Revolution since the 1940’s. Economy – America’s free market system created enormous societal wealth and dramatic improvements in quality of life for everyday people. Military – American military might drove victory in World War I and World War II, and then catalyzed the unilateral surrender and dissolution of the Soviet Union. Each of these dimensions reinforces the other two: Our technology preeminence powers our economy and our military. Our economic growth pays for our massive investment in technology and in our military. And our military dominance keeps us safe from foreign threats and hostile ideologies that could crush our technology, our economy, and our people. And, America’s success has positive global spillover effects to much of the rest of the world. American technology is the global standard. The American economy is the leading production and consumption partner of many other nations. And the American military has maintained overall global peace and prosperity since World War II to a level unprecedented in world history. Naysayers say America’s best days are behind us, that the 21st Century will see America play a diminished role in all three dimensions. There is no reason American technology, economic, and military leadership cannot continue for decades to come. There is no reason the 21st Century cannot be a Second American Century. American technology leadership is the result of a complex system built over the last 150 years that includes our pioneering spirit, our work ethic, our rule of law, our deep capital markets, our higher education system, and long term government investment in scientific research. And university, government, and corporate labs have all played key roles. But the vanguard of American technology supremacy has always been the startup. From Edison and Ford to Hughes and Lockheed to SpaceX and Tesla, the path to greatness starts in a garage. A startup is what happens when a plucky group of outcasts and misfits comes together with a dream, ambition, courage, and a particular set of skills – to build something new in the world, to build a product that will improve peoples’ lives, and to build a company that may go on to create many more new things in the future. The enormous advantage of any startup is a clean sheet of paper – a single shot to imagine and realize a different and better world. But startups start with every other disadvantage. Specifically, they must go up against incumbent companies that have overwhelmingly superior brands, market positions, customer bases, and financial strength – incumbents that are out to strangle startup competition in the cradle. Incumbents often have another enormous advantage – the ability to wire the government against startup competitors. Dominant companies don’t start out that way. In fact, they start as startups, fighting their way uphill until they reach a position of power where they seek to lock in their gains, to pull the rope ladder up behind them. They inject themselves into the political system and seek regulatory capture – a wall of laws and regulations that protect and entrench their positions, and that new startups cannot possibly scale. The historical result of regulatory capture in market after market has been government-enforced monopolies and cartels. And the motto of every monopoly and cartel is, “We don’t care, because we don’t have to.” When this cycle is allowed to play out, when big companies can weaponize the government against startups, the result is stagnation and then decline. There are many signs of stagnation and decline in the American economy today. Economists measure the rate of technology improvement in the economy as productivity growth. And productivity growth today, after 50 years of the proliferation of the profoundly powerful technologies of the computer and the Internet, is lower than before the 1970’s. The real-world consequences are staggering: Low productivity growth means low economic growth. Low economic growth means a low rate of improvement in quality of life for regular people, if not outright backsliding. See, for example, skyrocketing prices and stagnating quality of education, health care, and housing – sure signs of regulatory capture. Low economic growth also means the rise of smashmouth zero-sum politics, as gains for one group of people necessarily require taking things away from other people. Zero-sum politics lead to corrosion of the national spirit of opportunity and growth. We can feel this corrosion all around us. The way to prevent this outcome is to encourage new startups – to drive innovation, competition, and growth – and to prevent big companies from weaponizing the government to crush them. The American government is now far more hostile to new startups than it used to be. Regulatory agencies have been green lit to use brute force investigations, prosecutions, intimidation, and threats to hobble new industries, such as Blockchain. Regulatory agencies are being green lit in real time to do the same to Artificial Intelligence. Regulatory agencies are applying direct pressure to banks to cut off disfavored startups and founders from the financial system. Regulatory agencies are punitively blocking startups from being acquired by the same big companies the government is preferencing in so many other ways. The federal government as a customer in critical sectors like defense and intelligence is more wired than ever to favor big incumbents over innovative startups. And, the government is currently proposing a tax on unrealized capital gains, which would absolutely kill both startups and the venture capital industry that funds them. The anti-startup bias that is increasingly pervasive across the American government is a clear and present threat to the health and vitality of American technology success – and therefore to the American economy, the American military, and the American people. Why is this happening? In part, explicit decisions. In part, inertial drift. But also because tech startups as an industry do not show up in Washington D.C. and in the political system the way big companies do. As long as this imbalance persists, the war on tech startups and the resulting threat to America will continue. Therefore the need to politically defend Little Tech. Reversing ruinous policies is just one side of the coin. We can also imagine positive policies that encourage tech startups to flourish – benefiting those startups and their customers, and forcing big incumbents to stay vital and dynamic due to startup competition. Regulatory reform in important industries like health care, education, and housing, to strip incumbents of their current regulatory capture and drive higher quality at lower prices. Policies to reconstruct the American manufacturing sector around automation and AI, reshoring entire industries and creating millions of new middle class jobs. Reinvention of the American military industrial base by new companies building defense systems on the leading edge of autonomy and AI. Environmental reform to encourage the development and deployment of nuclear power for unlimited clean energy production. Expansion of high-skilled immigration to encourage foreign graduates of American universities and others to build new companies and industries here. And, a whole-of-government program to drive the success of US technology companies globally, against a hostile China and a regulation-crazed EU. We have no doubt that an American government that actually wants startups to succeed and new industries to flourish would drive enormous increases in the standard of living of regular Americans, and underwrite many more decades of American technology, economic, and military strength. The glory of a Second American Century is within our reach."}
{"text":"You live in a deranged age — more deranged than usual, because despite great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing. Our species is 300,000 years old. For the first 290,000 years, we were foragers, subsisting in a way that’s still observable among the Bushmen of the Kalahari and the Sentinelese of the Andaman Islands. Even after Homo Sapiens embraced agriculture, progress was painfully slow. A person born in Sumer in 4,000BC would find the resources, work, and technology available in England at the time of the Norman Conquest or in the Aztec Empire at the time of Columbus quite familiar. Then, beginning in the 18th Century, many people’s standard of living skyrocketed. What brought about this dramatic improvement, and why? There’s a way to do it better. Find it. We are being lied to. We are told that technology takes our jobs, reduces our wages, increases inequality, threatens our health, ruins the environment, degrades our society, corrupts our children, impairs our humanity, threatens our future, and is ever on the verge of ruining everything. We are told to be angry, bitter, and resentful about technology. We are told to be pessimistic. The myth of Prometheus – in various updated forms like Frankenstein, Oppenheimer, and Terminator – haunts our nightmares. We are told to denounce our birthright – our intelligence, our control over nature, our ability to build a better world. We are told to be miserable about the future. Our civilization was built on technology. Our civilization is built on technology. Technology is the glory of human ambition and achievement, the spearhead of progress, and the realization of our potential. For hundreds of years, we properly glorified this – until recently. I am here to bring the good news. We can advance to a far superior way of living, and of being. We have the tools, the systems, the ideas. It is time, once again, to raise the technology flag. It is time to be Techno-Optimists. Techno-Optimists believe that societies, like sharks, grow or die. We believe growth is progress – leading to vitality, expansion of life, increasing knowledge, higher well being. We agree with Paul Collier when he says, “Economic growth is not a cure-all, but lack of growth is a kill-all.” We believe everything good is downstream of growth. We believe not growing is stagnation, which leads to zero-sum thinking, internal fighting, degradation, collapse, and ultimately death. There are only three sources of growth: population growth, natural resource utilization, and technology. Developed societies are depopulating all over the world, across cultures – the total human population may already be shrinking. Natural resource utilization has sharp limits, both real and political. And so the only perpetual source of growth is technology. In fact, technology – new knowledge, new tools, what the Greeks called techne – has always been the main source of growth, and perhaps the only cause of growth, as technology made both population growth and natural resource utilization possible. We believe technology is a lever on the world – the way to make more with less. Economists measure technological progress as productivity growth: How much more we can produce each year with fewer inputs, fewer raw materials. Productivity growth, powered by technology, is the main driver of economic growth, wage growth, and the creation of new industries and new jobs, as people and capital are continuously freed to do more important, valuable things than in the past. Productivity growth causes prices to fall, supply to rise, and demand to expand, improving the material well being of the entire population. We believe this is the story of the material development of our civilization; this is why we are not still living in mud huts, eking out a meager survival and waiting for nature to kill us. We believe this is why our descendents will live in the stars. We believe that there is no material problem – whether created by nature or by technology – that cannot be solved with more technology. We had a problem of starvation, so we invented the Green Revolution. We had a problem of darkness, so we invented electric lighting. We had a problem of cold, so we invented indoor heating. We had a problem of heat, so we invented air conditioning. We had a problem of isolation, so we invented the Internet. We had a problem of pandemics, so we invented vaccines. We have a problem of poverty, so we invent technology to create abundance. Give us a real world problem, and we can invent technology that will solve it. We believe free markets are the most effective way to organize a technological economy. Willing buyer meets willing seller, a price is struck, both sides benefit from the exchange or it doesn’t happen. Profits are the incentive for producing supply that fulfills demand. Prices encode information about supply and demand. Markets cause entrepreneurs to seek out high prices as a signal of opportunity to create new wealth by driving those prices down. We believe the market economy is a discovery machine, a form of intelligence – an exploratory, evolutionary, adaptive system. We believe Hayek’s Knowledge Problem overwhelms any centralized economic system. All actual information is on the edges, in the hands of the people closest to the buyer. The center, abstracted away from both the buyer and the seller, knows nothing. Centralized planning is doomed to fail, the system of production and consumption is too complex. Decentralization harnesses complexity for the benefit of everyone; centralization will starve you to death. We believe in market discipline. The market naturally disciplines – the seller either learns and changes when the buyer fails to show, or exits the market. When market discipline is absent, there is no limit to how crazy things can get. The motto of every monopoly and cartel, every centralized institution not subject to market discipline: “We don’t care, because we don’t have to.” Markets prevent monopolies and cartels. We believe markets lift people out of poverty – in fact, markets are by far the most effective way to lift vast numbers of people out of poverty, and always have been. Even in totalitarian regimes, an incremental lifting of the repressive boot off the throat of the people and their ability to produce and trade leads to rapidly rising incomes and standards of living. Lift the boot a little more, even better. Take the boot off entirely, who knows how rich everyone can get. We believe markets are an inherently individualistic way to achieve superior collective outcomes. We believe markets do not require people to be perfect, or even well intentioned – which is good, because, have you met people? Adam Smith: “It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own self-interest. We address ourselves not to their humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities, but of their advantages.” David Friedman points out that people only do things for other people for three reasons – love, money, or force. Love doesn’t scale, so the economy can only run on money or force. The force experiment has been run and found wanting. Let’s stick with money. We believe the ultimate moral defense of markets is that they divert people who otherwise would raise armies and start religions into peacefully productive pursuits. We believe markets, to quote Nicholas Stern, are how we take care of people we don’t know. We believe markets are the way to generate societal wealth for everything else we want to pay for, including basic research, social welfare programs, and national defense. We believe there is no conflict between capitalist profits and a social welfare system that protects the vulnerable. In fact, they are aligned – the production of markets creates the economic wealth that pays for everything else we want as a society. We believe central economic planning elevates the worst of us and drags everyone down; markets exploit the best of us to benefit all of us. We believe central planning is a doom loop; markets are an upward spiral. The economist William Nordhaus has shown that creators of technology are only able to capture about 2% of the economic value created by that technology. The other 98% flows through to society in the form of what economists call social surplus. Technological innovation in a market system is inherently philanthropic, by a 50:1 ratio. Who gets more value from a new technology, the single company that makes it, or the millions or billions of people who use it to improve their lives? QED. We believe in David Ricardo’s concept of comparative advantage – as distinct from competitive advantage, comparative advantage holds that even someone who is best in the world at doing everything will buy most things from other people, due to opportunity cost. Comparative advantage in the context of a properly free market guarantees high employment regardless of the level of technology. We believe a market sets wages as a function of the marginal productivity of the worker. Therefore technology – which raises productivity – drives wages up, not down. This is perhaps the most counterintuitive idea in all of economics, but it’s true, and we have 300 years of history that prove it. We believe in Milton Friedman’s observation that human wants and needs are infinite. We believe markets also increase societal well being by generating work in which people can productively engage. We believe a Universal Basic Income would turn people into zoo animals to be farmed by the state. Man was not meant to be farmed; man was meant to be useful, to be productive, to be proud. We believe technological change, far from reducing the need for human work, increases it, by broadening the scope of what humans can productively do. We believe that since human wants and needs are infinite, economic demand is infinite, and job growth can continue forever. We believe markets are generative, not exploitative; positive sum, not zero sum. Participants in markets build on one another’s work and output. James Carse describes finite games and infinite games – finite games have an end, when one person wins and another person loses; infinite games never end, as players collaborate to discover what’s possible in the game. Markets are the ultimate infinite game. The Techno-Capital Machine Combine technology and markets and you get what Nick Land has termed the techno-capital machine, the engine of perpetual material creation, growth, and abundance. We believe the techno-capital machine of markets and innovation never ends, but instead spirals continuously upward. Comparative advantage increases specialization and trade. Prices fall, freeing up purchasing power, creating demand. Falling prices benefit everyone who buys goods and services, which is to say everyone. Human wants and needs are endless, and entrepreneurs continuously create new goods and services to satisfy those wants and needs, deploying unlimited numbers of people and machines in the process. This upward spiral has been running for hundreds of years, despite continuous howling from Communists and Luddites. Indeed, as of 2019, before the temporary COVID disruption, the result was the largest number of jobs at the highest wages and the highest levels of material living standards in the history of the planet. The techno-capital machine makes natural selection work for us in the realm of ideas. The best and most productive ideas win, and are combined and generate even better ideas. Those ideas materialize in the real world as technologically enabled goods and services that never would have emerged de novo. Ray Kurzweil defines his Law of Accelerating Returns: Technological advances tend to feed on themselves, increasing the rate of further advance. We believe in accelerationism – the conscious and deliberate propulsion of technological development – to ensure the fulfillment of the Law of Accelerating Returns. To ensure the techno-capital upward spiral continues forever. We believe the techno-capital machine is not anti-human – in fact, it may be the most pro-human thing there is. It serves us. The techno-capital machine works for us. All the machines work for us. We believe the cornerstone resources of the techno-capital upward spiral are intelligence and energy – ideas, and the power to make them real. We believe intelligence is the ultimate engine of progress. Intelligence makes everything better. Smart people and smart societies outperform less smart ones on virtually every metric we can measure. Intelligence is the birthright of humanity; we should expand it as fully and broadly as we possibly can. We believe intelligence is in an upward spiral – first, as more smart people around the world are recruited into the techno-capital machine; second, as people form symbiotic relationships with machines into new cybernetic systems such as companies and networks; third, as Artificial Intelligence ramps up the capabilities of our machines and ourselves. We believe we are poised for an intelligence takeoff that will expand our capabilities to unimagined heights. We believe Artificial Intelligence is our alchemy, our Philosopher’s Stone – we are literally making sand think. We believe Artificial Intelligence is best thought of as a universal problem solver. And we have a lot of problems to solve. We believe Artificial Intelligence can save lives – if we let it. Medicine, among many other fields, is in the stone age compared to what we can achieve with joined human and machine intelligence working on new cures. There are scores of common causes of death that can be fixed with AI, from car crashes to pandemics to wartime friendly fire. We believe any deceleration of AI will cost lives. Deaths that were preventable by the AI that was prevented from existing is a form of murder. We believe in Augmented Intelligence just as much as we believe in Artificial Intelligence. Intelligent machines augment intelligent humans, driving a geometric expansion of what humans can do. We believe Augmented Intelligence drives marginal productivity which drives wage growth which drives demand which drives the creation of new supply… with no upper bound. Energy is life. We take it for granted, but without it, we have darkness, starvation, and pain. With it, we have light, safety, and warmth. We believe energy should be in an upward spiral. Energy is the foundational engine of our civilization. The more energy we have, the more people we can have, and the better everyone’s lives can be. We should raise everyone to the energy consumption level we have, then increase our energy 1,000x, then raise everyone else’s energy 1,000x as well. The current gap in per-capita energy use between the smaller developed world and larger developing world is enormous. That gap will close – either by massively expanding energy production, making everyone better off, or by massively reducing energy production, making everyone worse off. We believe energy need not expand to the detriment of the natural environment. We have the silver bullet for virtually unlimited zero-emissions energy today – nuclear fission. In 1973, President Richard Nixon called for Project Independence, the construction of 1,000 nuclear power plants by the year 2000, to achieve complete US energy independence. Nixon was right; we didn’t build the plants then, but we can now, anytime we decide we want to. Atomic Energy Commissioner Thomas Murray said in 1953: “For years the splitting atom, packaged in weapons, has been our main shield against the barbarians. Now, in addition, it is a God-given instrument to do the constructive work of mankind.” Murray was right too. We believe a second energy silver bullet is coming – nuclear fusion. We should build that as well. The same bad ideas that effectively outlawed fission are going to try to outlaw fusion. We should not let them. We believe there is no inherent conflict between the techno-capital machine and the natural environment. Per-capita US carbon emissions are lower now than they were 100 years ago, even without nuclear power. We believe technology is the solution to environmental degradation and crisis. A technologically advanced society improves the natural environment, a technologically stagnant society ruins it. If you want to see environmental devastation, visit a former Communist country. The socialist USSR was far worse for the natural environment than the capitalist US. Google the Aral Sea. We believe a technologically stagnant society has limited energy at the cost of environmental ruin; a technologically advanced society has unlimited clean energy for everyone. We believe we should place intelligence and energy in a positive feedback loop, and drive them both to infinity. We believe we should use the feedback loop of intelligence and energy to make everything we want and need abundant. We believe the measure of abundance is falling prices. Every time a price falls, the universe of people who buy it get a raise in buying power, which is the same as a raise in income. If a lot of goods and services drop in price, the result is an upward explosion of buying power, real income, and quality of life. We believe that if we make both intelligence and energy “too cheap to meter”, the ultimate result will be that all physical goods become as cheap as pencils. Pencils are actually quite technologically complex and difficult to manufacture, and yet nobody gets mad if you borrow a pencil and fail to return it. We should make the same true of all physical goods. We believe we should push to drop prices across the economy through the application of technology until as many prices are effectively zero as possible, driving income levels and quality of life into the stratosphere. We believe Andy Warhol was right when he said, “What’s great about this country is America started the tradition where the richest consumers buy essentially the same things as the poorest. You can be watching TV and see Coca-Cola, and you can know that the President drinks Coke, Liz Taylor drinks Coke, and just think, you can drink Coke, too. A Coke is a Coke and no amount of money can get you a better Coke than the one the bum on the corner is drinking. All the Cokes are the same and all the Cokes are good.” Same for the browser, the smartphone, the chatbot. We believe that technology ultimately drives the world to what Buckminster Fuller called “ephemeralization” – what economists call “dematerialization”. Fuller: “Technology lets you do more and more with less and less until eventually you can do everything with nothing.” We believe technological progress therefore leads to material abundance for everyone. We believe the ultimate payoff from technological abundance can be a massive expansion in what Julian Simon called “the ultimate resource” – people. We believe, as Simon did, that people are the ultimate resource – with more people come more creativity, more new ideas, and more technological progress. We believe material abundance therefore ultimately means more people – a lot more people – which in turn leads to more abundance. We believe our planet is dramatically underpopulated, compared to the population we could have with abundant intelligence, energy, and material goods. We believe the global population can quite easily expand to 50 billion people or more, and then far beyond that as we ultimately settle other planets. We believe that out of all of these people will come scientists, technologists, artists, and visionaries beyond our wildest dreams. We believe the ultimate mission of technology is to advance life both on Earth and in the stars. Not Utopia, But Close Enough However, we are not Utopians. We are adherents to what Thomas Sowell calls the Constrained Vision. We believe the Constrained Vision – contra the Unconstrained Vision of Utopia, Communism, and Expertise – means taking people as they are, testing ideas empirically, and liberating people to make their own choices. We believe in not Utopia, but also not Apocalypse. We believe change only happens on the margin – but a lot of change across a very large margin can lead to big outcomes. While not Utopian, we believe in what Brad DeLong terms “slouching toward Utopia” – doing the best fallen humanity can do, making things better as we go. Becoming Technological Supermen We believe that advancing technology is one of the most virtuous things that we can do. We believe in deliberately and systematically transforming ourselves into the kind of people who can advance technology. We believe this certainly means technical education, but it also means going hands on, gaining practical skills, working within and leading teams – aspiring to build something greater than oneself, aspiring to work with others to build something greater as a group. We believe the natural human drive to make things, to gain territory, to explore the unknown can be channeled productively into building technology. We believe that while the physical frontier, at least here on Earth, is closed, the technological frontier is wide open. We believe in exploring and claiming the technological frontier. We believe in the romance of technology, of industry. The eros of the train, the car, the electric light, the skyscraper. And the microchip, the neural network, the rocket, the split atom. We believe in adventure. Undertaking the Hero’s Journey, rebelling against the status quo, mapping uncharted territory, conquering dragons, and bringing home the spoils for our community. To paraphrase a manifesto of a different time and place: “Beauty exists only in struggle. There is no masterpiece that has not an aggressive character. Technology must be a violent assault on the forces of the unknown, to force them to bow before man.” We believe that we are, have been, and will always be the masters of technology, not mastered by technology. Victim mentality is a curse in every domain of life, including in our relationship with technology – both unnecessary and self-defeating. We are not victims, we are conquerors. We believe in nature, but we also believe in overcoming nature. We are not primitives, cowering in fear of the lightning bolt. We are the apex predator; the lightning works for us. We believe in greatness. We admire the great technologists and industrialists who came before us, and we aspire to make them proud of us today. And we believe in humanity – individually and collectively. We believe in ambition, aggression, persistence, relentlessness – strength. We believe in merit and achievement. We believe in bravery, in courage. We believe in pride, confidence, and self respect – when earned. We believe in free thought, free speech, and free inquiry. We believe in the actual Scientific Method and enlightenment values of free discourse and challenging the authority of experts. We believe, as Richard Feynman said, “Science is the belief in the ignorance of experts.” And, “I would rather have questions that can’t be answered than answers that can’t be questioned.” We believe in local knowledge, the people with actual information making decisions, not in playing God. We believe in embracing variance, in increasing interestingness. We believe in risk, in leaps into the unknown. We believe in agency, in individualism. We believe in radical competence. We believe in an absolute rejection of resentment. As Carrie Fisher said, “Resentment is like drinking poison and waiting for the other person to die.” We take responsibility and we overcome. We believe in competition, because we believe in evolution. We believe in evolution, because we believe in life. We believe in the truth. We believe rich is better than poor, cheap is better than expensive, and abundant is better than scarce. We believe in making everyone rich, everything cheap, and everything abundant. We believe extrinsic motivations – wealth, fame, revenge – are fine as far as they go. But we believe intrinsic motivations – the satisfaction of building something new, the camaraderie of being on a team, the achievement of becoming a better version of oneself – are more fulfilling and more lasting. We believe in what the Greeks called eudaimonia through arete – flourishing through excellence. We believe technology is universalist. Technology doesn’t care about your ethnicity, race, religion, national origin, gender, sexuality, political views, height, weight, hair or lack thereof. Technology is built by a virtual United Nations of talent from all over the world. Anyone with a positive attitude and a cheap laptop can contribute. Technology is the ultimate open society. We believe in the Silicon Valley code of “pay it forward”, trust via aligned incentives, generosity of spirit to help one another learn and grow. We believe America and her allies should be strong and not weak. We believe national strength of liberal democracies flows from economic strength (financial power), cultural strength (soft power), and military strength (hard power). Economic, cultural, and military strength flow from technological strength. A technologically strong America is a force for good in a dangerous world. Technologically strong liberal democracies safeguard liberty and peace. Technologically weak liberal democracies lose to their autocratic rivals, making everyone worse off. We believe technology makes greatness more possible and more likely. We believe in fulfilling our potential, becoming fully human – for ourselves, our communities, and our society. Techno-Optimism is a material philosophy, not a political philosophy. We are not necessarily left wing, although some of us are. We are not necessarily right wing, although some of us are. We are materially focused, for a reason – to open the aperture on how we may choose to live amid material abundance. A common critique of technology is that it removes choice from our lives as machines make decisions for us. This is undoubtedly true, yet more than offset by the freedom to create our lives that flows from the material abundance created by our use of machines. Material abundance from markets and technology opens the space for religion, for politics, and for choices of how to live, socially and individually. We believe technology is liberatory. Liberatory of human potential. Liberatory of the human soul, the human spirit. Expanding what it can mean to be free, to be fulfilled, to be alive. We believe technology opens the space of what it can mean to be human. Our enemies are not bad people – but rather bad ideas. Our present society has been subjected to a mass demoralization campaign for six decades – against technology and against life – under varying names like “existential risk”, “sustainability”, “ESG”, “Sustainable Development Goals”, “social responsibility”, “stakeholder capitalism”, “Precautionary Principle”, “trust and safety”, “tech ethics”, “risk management”, “de-growth”, “the limits of growth”. This demoralization campaign is based on bad ideas of the past – zombie ideas, many derived from Communism, disastrous then and now – that have refused to die. Our enemy is stagnation. Our enemy is anti-merit, anti-ambition, anti-striving, anti-achievement, anti-greatness. Our enemy is statism, authoritarianism, collectivism, central planning, socialism. Our enemy is bureaucracy, vetocracy, gerontocracy, blind deference to tradition. Our enemy is corruption, regulatory capture, monopolies, cartels. Our enemy is institutions that in their youth were vital and energetic and truth-seeking, but are now compromised and corroded and collapsing – blocking progress in increasingly desperate bids for continued relevance, frantically trying to justify their ongoing funding despite spiraling dysfunction and escalating ineptness. Our enemy is the ivory tower, the know-it-all credentialed expert worldview, indulging in abstract theories, luxury beliefs, social engineering, disconnected from the real world, delusional, unelected, and unaccountable – playing God with everyone else’s lives, with total insulation from the consequences. Our enemy is speech control and thought control – the increasing use, in plain sight, of George Orwell’s “1984” as an instruction manual. Our enemy is Thomas Sowell’s Unconstrained Vision, Alexander Kojeve’s Universal and Homogeneous State, Thomas More’s Utopia. Our enemy is the Precautionary Principle, which would have prevented virtually all progress since man first harnessed fire. The Precautionary Principle was invented to prevent the large-scale deployment of civilian nuclear power, perhaps the most catastrophic mistake in Western society in my lifetime. The Precautionary Principle continues to inflict enormous unnecessary suffering on our world today. It is deeply immoral, and we must jettison it with extreme prejudice. Our enemy is deceleration, de-growth, depopulation – the nihilistic wish, so trendy among our elites, for fewer people, less energy, and more suffering and death. Our enemy is Friedrich Nietzsche’s Last Man: I tell you: one must still have chaos in oneself, to give birth to a dancing star. I tell you: you have still chaos in yourselves. Alas! There comes the time when man will no longer give birth to any star. Alas! There comes the time of the most despicable man, who can no longer despise himself… “What is love? What is creation? What is longing? What is a star?” — so asks the Last Man, and blinks. The earth has become small, and on it hops the Last Man, who makes everything small. His species is ineradicable as the flea; the Last Man lives longest… One still works, for work is a pastime. But one is careful lest the pastime should hurt one. One no longer becomes poor or rich; both are too burdensome… No shepherd, and one herd! Everyone wants the same; everyone is the same: he who feels differently goes voluntarily into the madhouse. “Formerly all the world was insane,” — say the subtlest of them, and they blink. They are clever and know all that has happened: so there is no end to their derision… “We have discovered happiness,” — say the Last Men, and they blink. We aspire to be… not that. We will explain to people captured by these zombie ideas that their fears are unwarranted and the future is bright. We believe these captured people are suffering from ressentiment – a witches’ brew of resentment, bitterness, and rage that is causing them to hold mistaken values, values that are damaging to both themselves and the people they care about. We believe we must help them find their way out of their self-imposed labyrinth of pain. We invite everyone to join us in Techno-Optimism. Become our allies in the pursuit of technology, abundance, and life. Where did we come from? Our civilization was built on a spirit of discovery, of exploration, of industrialization. What world are we building for our children and their children, and their children? A world of fear, guilt, and resentment? Or a world of ambition, abundance, and adventure? We believe in the words of David Deutsch: “We have a duty to be optimistic. Because the future is open, not predetermined and therefore cannot just be accepted: we are all responsible for what it holds. Thus it is our duty to fight for a better world.” We owe the past, and the future. It’s time to be a Techno-Optimist. Patron Saints of Techno-Optimism In lieu of detailed endnotes and citations, read the work of these people, and you too will become a Techno-Optimist.

Más de 10 años después del pico de la burbuja de puntocom de la década de 1990, aproximadamente una docena de nuevas empresas de Internet como Facebook y Twitter están generando controversia en Silicon Valley, debido a sus valuaciones de mercado privado de rápido crecimiento, e incluso a la exitosa oferta pública inicial ocasional. Con las cicatrices del apogeo de Webvan y Pets.com aún frescas en la psique de los inversores, la gente pregunta: “¿No es esto solo una nueva burbuja peligrosa?” Yo, junto con otros, he estado discutiendo el otro lado del caso. (Soy cofundador y socio general de la empresa de capital de riesgo Andreessen-Horowitz, que ha invertido en Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga y Foursquare, entre otros. También soy un inversionista personal en LinkedIn). Creemos que muchas de las nuevas y prominentes empresas de Internet están construyendo negocios reales, de alto crecimiento, de alto margen y altamente defendibles. En realidad, el mercado bursátil actual odia la tecnología, como lo demuestran los bajos índices de precios/ganancias de todos los tiempos para las principales empresas de tecnología pública. Apple, por ejemplo, tiene una relación de precio-beneficio de alrededor de 15,2, casi la misma que el mercado de valores en general, a pesar de la inmensa rentabilidad y la posición dominante en el mercado de Apple (esta se convirtió en las últimas dos semanas en la compañía más grande de Estados Unidos, a juzgar por la capitalización de mercado, superando a Exxon Mobil). Y, tal vez la mayoría de las veces, no se puede tener una burbuja cuando la gente grita constantemente “¡Burbuja!” Pero gran parte del debate sigue girando en torno a la valoración financiera, a diferencia del valor intrínseco subyacente de las mejores empresas nuevas de Silicon Valley. Mi propia teoría es que estamos en medio de un cambio tecnológico y económico dramático y amplio en el que las empresas de software están preparadas para apoderarse de grandes sectores de la economía. Cada vez más empresas e industrias importantes funcionan con software y se ofrecen como servicios en línea, desde películas hasta agricultura y defensa nacional. Muchos de los ganadores son empresas de tecnología empresarial al estilo de Silicon Valley que están invadiendo y revocando estructuras industriales establecidas. Durante los próximos 10 años, espero que muchas más industrias se vean afectadas por el software, con nuevas empresas de Silicon Valley líderes en el mundo haciendo la disrupción en la mayoría de los casos. ¿Por qué está sucediendo esto ahora? Seis décadas después de la revolución informática, cuatro décadas desde la invención del microprocesador y dos décadas después del surgimiento de la Internet moderna, toda la tecnología necesaria para transformar las industrias a través del software finalmente funciona y puede distribuirse ampliamente a escala global. Más de dos mil millones de personas ahora usan Internet de banda ancha, un aumento con respecto a los 50 millones de personas hace una década, cuando estaba en Netscape, la compañía que cofundé. En los próximos 10 años, espero que al menos cinco mil millones de personas en todo el mundo posean teléfonos inteligentes, lo que le dará a cada persona con un teléfono de este tipo acceso instantáneo a toda la potencia de Internet, en cada momento de cada día. En el backend, las herramientas de programación de software y los servicios basados en Internet facilitan el lanzamiento de nuevas empresas globales impulsadas por software en muchas industrias, sin la necesidad de invertir en nueva infraestructura y capacitar a nuevos empleados. En el año 2000, cuando mi socio Ben Horowitz fue director ejecutivo de la primera empresa de computación en la nube, Loudcloud, el costo de que un cliente ejecutara una aplicación básica de Internet era de aproximadamente 150 000 USD al mes. Ejecutar esa misma aplicación hoy en la nube de Amazon cuesta alrededor de 1500 USD al mes. Con costos iniciales más bajos y un mercado ampliamente expandido para los servicios en línea, el resultado es una economía global que, por primera vez, estará completamente conectada digitalmente: el sueño de todo cibervisionario de principios de la década de 1990, finalmente entregado, una generación completa más tarde. Quizás el ejemplo más dramático de este fenómeno del software que se come un negocio tradicional es el suicidio de Borders y el correspondiente ascenso de Amazon. En 2001, Borders acordó entregar su negocio en línea a Amazon bajo la teoría de que las ventas de libros en línea no eran estratégicas ni importantes. Hoy en día, el mayor vendedor de libros del mundo, Amazon, es una compañía de software, su capacidad principal es su increíble motor de software para vender prácticamente todo en línea, sin necesidad de tiendas minoristas. Además de eso, mientras Borders estaba en medio de una inminente bancarrota, Amazon reorganizó su sitio web para promocionar sus libros digitales Kindle sobre los libros físicos por primera vez. Ahora incluso los libros en sí son software. El servicio de video más grande de la actualidad por cantidad de suscriptores es una compañía de software: Netflix. Cómo Netflix destripó a Blockbuster es una vieja historia, pero ahora otros proveedores de entretenimiento tradicionales enfrentan la misma amenaza. Comcast, Time Warner y otros responden transformándose en empresas de software con esfuerzos como TV Everywhere, que libera contenido del cable físico y lo conecta a teléfonos inteligentes y tabletas. Las compañías de música dominantes de hoy en día también son compañías de software: iTunes, Spotify y Pandora de Apple. Los sellos discográficos tradicionales existen cada vez más solo para proporcionar contenido a esas compañías de software. Los ingresos de la industria provenientes de canales digitales alcanzaron un total de 4600 millones de dólares en 2010, aumentando del 2 % al 29 % de los ingresos totales en 2004. Las empresas de entretenimiento de más rápido crecimiento en la actualidad son fabricantes de videojuegos (de nuevo, software) y la industria crece a 60 mil millones de dólares desde los 30 mil millones de dólares de hace cinco años. Y la principal empresa de videojuegos de más rápido crecimiento es Zynga (fabricante de juegos, incluida FarmVille), que ofrece sus juegos completamente en línea. Los ingresos de Zynga en el primer trimestre crecieron a 235 millones de USD este año, más del doble de ingresos que un año atrás. Se espera que Rovio, fabricante de Angry Birds, obtenga 100 millones de USD en ingresos este año (la compañía estaba casi en bancarrota cuando debutó el popular juego en el iPhone a fines de 2009). Mientras tanto, las potencias de videojuegos tradicionales como Electronic Arts y Nintendo han visto que los ingresos se estancan y caen. Pixar, la mejor empresa nueva de producción de películas en muchas décadas, fue una empresa de software. Disney (¡Disney!) tuvo que comprar Pixar, una compañía de software, para seguir siendo relevante en las películas animadas. La fotografía, por supuesto, fue consumida por el software hace mucho tiempo. Es prácticamente imposible comprar un teléfono móvil que no incluya una cámara impulsada por software, y las fotos se cargan automáticamente a Internet para su archivo permanente y uso compartido global. Empresas como Shutterfly, Snapfish y Flickr han entrado en el lugar de Kodak. La plataforma de marketing directo más grande de la actualidad es una compañía de software: Google. Ahora se ha unido a Groupon, Living Social, Foursquare y otros, que utilizan software para comer a la industria de marketing minorista. Groupon generó más de 700 millones de USD en ingresos en 2010, después de haber estado en el negocio durante solo dos años. La empresa de telecomunicaciones de más rápido crecimiento en la actualidad es Skype, una empresa de software que acaba de comprar Microsoft por 8500 millones de USD. CenturyLink, la tercera empresa de telecomunicaciones más grande de los EE. UU., con una capitalización de mercado de 20 000 millones de USD, tenía 15 millones de líneas de acceso a fines del 30 de junio, lo que disminuyó a una tasa anual de alrededor del 7 %. Sin incluir los ingresos de su adquisición en Qwest, los ingresos de CenturyLink de estos servicios heredados disminuyeron en más del 11 %. Mientras tanto, las dos empresas de telecomunicaciones más grandes, AT&T y Verizon, han sobrevivido al transformarse en empresas de software, al asociarse con Apple y otros fabricantes de teléfonos inteligentes. LinkedIn es la empresa de reclutamiento de más rápido crecimiento en la actualidad. Por primera vez, en LinkedIn, los empleados pueden mantener sus propios currículums para que los reclutadores busquen en tiempo real, lo que les da a LinkedIn la oportunidad de comer la lucrativa industria de reclutamiento de 400 mil millones de USD. El software también está comiendo gran parte de la cadena de valor de las industrias que se consideran ampliamente existentes principalmente en el mundo físico. En los automóviles actuales, el software ejecuta los motores, controla las características de seguridad, entretiene a los pasajeros, guía a los conductores hacia destinos y conecta cada automóvil a redes móviles, satelitales y GPS. Los días en que un aficionado a los automóviles podía reparar su propio automóvil quedaron atrás, debido principalmente al alto contenido de software. La tendencia hacia los vehículos híbridos y eléctricos solo acelerará el cambio de software: los automóviles eléctricos están completamente controlados por computadora. Y la creación de automóviles sin conductor impulsados por software ya está en marcha en Google y las principales compañías de automóviles. El minorista líder en el mundo real de hoy, Wal-Mart, utiliza software para potenciar sus capacidades de logística y distribución, que ha utilizado para aplastar a su competencia. Igualmente para FedEx, que es considerada mejor como una red de software que tiene camiones, aviones y centros de distribución conectados. Y el éxito o fracaso de las aerolíneas hoy y en el futuro depende de su capacidad para cotizar boletos y optimizar rutas y rendimientos correctamente, con software. Las empresas de petróleo y gas fueron los primeros innovadores en la supercomputación y visualización y análisis de datos, que son cruciales para los esfuerzos actuales de exploración de petróleo y gas. La agricultura también está cada vez más impulsada por el software, incluido el análisis satelital de suelos vinculados a algoritmos de software de selección de semillas por acre. La industria de servicios financieros ha sido visiblemente transformada por el software durante los últimos 30 años. Prácticamente todas las transacciones financieras, desde alguien que compra una taza de café hasta alguien que comercializa un billón de dólares de derivados de incumplimiento de crédito, se realizan en software. Y muchos de los innovadores líderes en servicios financieros son empresas de software, como Square, que permite a cualquier persona aceptar pagos con tarjeta de crédito con un teléfono móvil y PayPal, que generó más de mil millones de USD en ingresos en el segundo trimestre de este año, un aumento del 31 % con respecto al año anterior. En mi opinión, la atención médica y la educación están a la vanguardia para la transformación fundamental basada en software. Mi empresa de capital de riesgo está apoyando empresas emergentes agresivas en estas industrias gigantes y críticas. Creemos que estas dos industrias, que históricamente se han resistido mucho al cambio empresarial, están preparadas para recibir propinas de grandes nuevos empresarios centrados en el software. Incluso la defensa nacional se basa cada vez más en software. El soldado de combate moderno está integrado en una red de software que proporciona inteligencia, comunicaciones, logística y orientación sobre armas. Los drones impulsados por software lanzan ataques aéreos sin poner en riesgo a los pilotos humanos. Las agencias de inteligencia realizan minería de datos a gran escala con software para descubrir y rastrear posibles conspiraciones terroristas. Las empresas de todas las industrias deben asumir que se acerca una revolución de software. Esto incluye incluso industrias que actualmente se basan en software. Las grandes empresas de software establecidas como Oracle y Microsoft se ven cada vez más amenazadas por la irrelevancia de las nuevas ofertas de software como Salesforce.com y Android (especialmente en un mundo en el que Google posee un importante fabricante de teléfonos). En algunas industrias, particularmente aquellas con un componente pesado del mundo real como el petróleo y el gas, la revolución del software es principalmente una oportunidad para los titulares. Pero en muchas industrias, las nuevas ideas de software darán como resultado el surgimiento de nuevas empresas emergentes al estilo de Silicon Valley que invaden las industrias existentes con impunidad. Durante los próximos 10 años, las batallas entre los titulares y los insurgentes impulsados por software serán épicas. Joseph Schumpeter, el economista que acuñó el término “destrucción creativa”, estaría orgulloso. Y aunque las personas que observan los valores de sus 401(k) rebotar hacia arriba y hacia abajo en las últimas semanas pueden dudarlo, esta es una historia profundamente positiva para la economía estadounidense en particular. No es un accidente que muchas de las empresas de tecnología más grandes, incluidas Google, Amazon, eBay y más, sean empresas estadounidenses. Nuestra combinación de excelentes universidades de investigación, una cultura empresarial a favor del riesgo, fondos profundos de capital social en busca de innovación y leyes comerciales y contractuales confiables no tiene precedentes ni tiene paralelo en el mundo. Aun así, enfrentamos varios desafíos. En primer lugar, cada empresa nueva actual se está construyendo frente a enormes dificultades económicas, lo que hace que el desafío sea mucho mayor que en los relativamente benignos años 90. La buena noticia sobre la construcción de una empresa en tiempos como este es que las empresas que tienen éxito serán extremadamente fuertes y resilientes. Y cuando la economía finalmente se estabilice, esté atento: lo mejor de las nuevas empresas crecerá aún más rápido. En segundo lugar, muchas personas en los EE. UU. y en todo el mundo carecen de la educación y las habilidades necesarias para participar en las grandes empresas nuevas que salen de la revolución del software. Esta es una tragedia, ya que cada compañía con la que trabajo está absolutamente hambrienta de talento. Los ingenieros de software, gerentes, especialistas en marketing y vendedores calificados en Silicon Valley pueden acumular docenas de ofertas de trabajo de alto salario y alto rendimiento en cualquier momento que lo deseen, mientras que el desempleo nacional y el subempleo son muy altos. Este problema es aún peor de lo que parece porque muchos trabajadores de las industrias existentes quedarán varados del lado equivocado de la interrupción basada en software y es posible que nunca puedan volver a trabajar en sus campos. No hay manera de superar este problema más allá de la educación, y tenemos un largo camino por recorrer. Por último, las nuevas empresas deben demostrar su valor. Necesitan construir culturas sólidas, deleitar a sus clientes, establecer sus propias ventajas competitivas y, sí, justificar sus valuaciones en aumento. Nadie debería esperar que la construcción de una nueva empresa de alto crecimiento impulsada por software en una industria establecida sea fácil. Es brutalmente difícil. Tengo el privilegio de trabajar con algunas de las mejores empresas de software, y puedo decirles que son realmente buenas en lo que hacen. Si se desempeñan según mis expectativas y las de los demás, serán compañías fundamentales altamente valiosas en la economía global, comiendo mercados mucho más grandes de lo que la industria tecnológica ha podido históricamente perseguir. En lugar de cuestionar constantemente sus valuaciones, busquemos comprender cómo la nueva generación de empresas de tecnología está haciendo lo que hacen, cuáles son las consecuencias más amplias para las empresas y la economía y qué podemos hacer colectivamente para ampliar la cantidad de nuevas empresas de software innovadoras creadas en los EE. UU. y en todo el mundo. Esa es la gran oportunidad. Sé adónde va mi dinero. Publicado originalmente en The Wall Street Journal el 20 de agosto de 2011."}
{"text":"Read this article in English.   /   Lee este artículo en Español. O software está engolindo o mundo. Mais de dez anos depois do pico da bolha da internet, ou das empresas “pontocom”, na década de 1990, alguns novos players da internet, como Facebook e Twitter, estão causando polêmica no Vale do Silício com o rápido aumento de seu valor no mercado privado e eventuais ofertas públicas iniciais bem-sucedidas. Com as cicatrizes da falência da Webvan e da Pets.com ainda vivas na cabeça dos investidores, as pessoas estão se perguntando: “Não seria apenas outra bolha perigosa?” Tenho defendido, e não estou sozinho nisso, o outro lado desta história. Sou cofundador e sócio da empresa de capital de risco Andreessen-Horowitz, que investiu no Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga e Foursquare, entre outros. Individualmente, também sou investidor no LinkedIn. Nós acreditamos que muitas das novas empresas da internet de destaque estão construindo negócios reais, altamente sustentáveis, com grande potencial de crescimento e margens elevadas. Hoje, o mercado de ações odeia a tecnologia, como se pode ver pelas relações preço/lucro das principais empresas de tecnologia de capital aberto, que são as mais baixas já vistas. A Apple, por exemplo, tem uma relação P/L de cerca de 15,2 – quase a mesma que o mercado de ações geral, apesar da enorme lucratividade e posição dominante da Apple no mercado (nas últimas duas semanas, tornou-se a maior empresa dos EUA, com base na capitalização de mercado, superando a Exxon Mobil). Além disso, talvez o sinal mais revelador seja que não é possível haver uma bolha quando as pessoas estão gritando “Bolha!” o tempo todo. Entretanto, muito do debate ainda gira em torno da valorização financeira e não do valor intrínseco subjacente das melhores novas empresas do Vale do Silício. Minha teoria é que estamos vivendo uma transformação tecnológica e econômica extensa e radical, com as empresas de software prontas para dominar grandes áreas da economia. Cada vez mais, grandes negócios e setores estão sendo administrados por softwares e entregues como serviços on-line – de filmes a agricultura e defesa nacional. Muitas das empresas bem-sucedidas são negócios de tecnologia empreendedores, ao estilo do Vale do Silício, que estão invadindo e subvertendo as estruturas estabelecidas dos setores. Nos próximos dez anos, imagino que muito mais segmentos sejam afetados por softwares, sendo essa disruptura provocada, na maior parte das vezes, por novas empresas do Vale do Silício, que serão líderes mundiais. Por que isso está acontecendo agora? Seis décadas depois da revolução da informática, quatro décadas depois da invenção do microprocessador e duas décadas depois do surgimento da internet moderna, toda a tecnologia necessária para transformar setores usando software finalmente deu certo e pode ser entregue amplamente, em escala global. Nos dias de hoje, mais de 2 bilhões de pessoas usam internet banda larga, em comparação com, talvez, 50 milhões há uma década, quando eu estava na Netscape, da qual fui cofundador. Nos próximos dez anos, imagino que pelo menos 5 bilhões de pessoas ao redor do mundo terão smartphones, o que lhes dará acesso imediato a todo o potencial da internet, a qualquer instante, todos os dias. No back-end, ferramentas de programação e serviços baseados na internet facilitam o lançamento de novas startups globais centradas em software em muitos segmentos — sem a necessidade de investimento em infraestrutura e treinamento de novos funcionários. No ano 2000, quando meu sócio Ben Horowitz era CEO da primeira empresa de computação em nuvem, a Loudcloud, o custo da execução de um aplicativo de internet básico por um cliente era de cerca de US$ 150 mil por mês. A execução desse mesmo aplicativo na nuvem da Amazon custa hoje cerca de US$ 1.500 por mês. Com custos iniciais mais baixos e um mercado muito mais amplo para serviços on-line, o resultado é uma economia global que, pela primeira vez, será conectada de modo totalmente digital — o sonho de todo cibervisionário do início dos anos 1990 finalmente concretizado uma geração depois. Talvez o exemplo mais dramático desse fenômeno do software engolindo um negócio tradicional seja o suicídio da Borders e, por conseguinte, a ascensão da Amazon. Em 2001, a Borders aceitou entregar seu negócio de vendas on-line para a Amazon, acreditando ser uma área não estratégica e sem importância. Hoje a maior livraria do mundo, a Amazon é uma empresa de software: sua principal capacidade é o fantástico mecanismo de software para vender praticamente tudo on-line, sem a necessidade de lojas físicas. Além disso, enquanto a Borders se debatia à beira da falência, a Amazon reorganizou seu site para, pela primeira vez, promover seus livros digitais Kindle mais do que os livros físicos. Os próprios livros passaram a ser software. O maior serviço de vídeo em número de assinantes atualmente é uma empresa de software: a Netflix. A história de como a Netflix acabou com a Blockbuster já é página virada, mas agora, outros provedores de entretenimento tradicionais estão enfrentando a mesma ameaça. Comcast, Time Warner e outras estão reagindo e se transformando em empresas de software, com iniciativas como a TV Everywhere, que liberta o conteúdo do cabo físico e o conecta a smartphones e tablets. As principais gravadoras também são empresas de software: iTunes da Apple, Spotify e Pandora. Cada vez mais, os selos tradicionais existem apenas para fornecer conteúdo para essas empresas de software. A receita gerada por canais digitais desse segmento totalizou US$ 4,6 bilhões em 2010, aumentado de 2% da receita total em 2004 para 29%. As empresas de entretenimento que mais crescem na atualidade são desenvolvedoras de videogames – ou seja, software –, com o segmento expandindo de US$ 30 bilhões há cinco anos para US$ 60 bilhões. Entre as maiores, a empresa de videogames que mais cresce é a Zynga, criadora do FarmVille, que entrega seus jogos totalmente on-line. A receita da Zynga no primeiro trimestre mais que o dobrou em relação ao ano anterior, subindo para US$ 235 milhões este ano. A receita da Rovio, desenvolvedora do Angry Birds, deve chegar a US$ 100 milhões este ano – a empresa estava quase falida quando lançou para iPhone o jogo hoje famoso, no final de 2009. Enquanto isso, tradicionais potências como Electronic Arts e Nintendo viram suas receitas estagnarem e caírem. A Pixar, melhor nova produtora de filmes em muitas décadas, era uma empresa de software. A Disney – a Disney! – precisou comprar a Pixar, uma empresa de software, para manter sua relevância em filmes de animação. A fotografia, é claro, foi engolida por software há muito tempo. É literalmente impossível comprar um celular que não tenha câmera com software e as fotos são carregadas automaticamente para a internet para arquivamento permanente e compartilhamento global. Empresas como Shutterfly, Snapfish e Flickr ocuparam o lugar da Kodak. A maior plataforma de marketing direto neste momento é uma empresa de software: a Google. Agora, juntaram-se a ela Groupon, Living Social, Foursquare, entre outras, que estão usando software para engolir o setor de marketing de varejo. A Groupon gerou mais de US$ 700 milhões em receita em 2010, depois de apenas dois anos no mercado. O negócio de telecomunicações que mais cresce hoje é o Skype, uma empresa de software que acabou de ser comprada pela Microsoft por US$ 8,5 bilhões. A CenturyLink, terceira maior empresa de telecomunicações dos Estados Unidos, com valor de mercado de US$ 20 bilhões, contava com 15 milhões de linhas de acesso em 30 de junho – uma queda de cerca de 7% ao ano.  Sem considerar a receita da aquisição da Qwest, a receita da CenturyLink com esses serviços legados caiu em mais de 11%. Enquanto isso, as duas maiores empresas de telecomunicação, AT&T e Verizon, sobreviveram transformando-se em empresas de software, em parceria com a Apple e outros fabricantes de smartphones. LinkedIn é a empresa de recrutamento que mais cresce atualmente. Pela primeira vez na história, profissionais podem manter seus currículos em uma plataforma para que recrutadores façam buscas em tempo real – o que dá ao LinkedIn a oportunidade de engolir esse lucrativo setor de US$ 400 bilhões que é o recrutamento. Softwares também estão engolindo boa parte da cadeia de valor de segmentos vistos, de modo geral, como sendo do mundo físico. Nos carros atuais, softwares movem os motores, controlam os recursos de segurança, entretêm os passageiros, guiam os motoristas aos destinos e conectam cada carro com redes de telefonia móvel, satélite e GPS. Estão distantes os dias em que pessoas apaixonadas por automóveis conseguiam consertar seus próprios carros e isso se deve, basicamente, ao extenso conteúdo de software. A tendência dos veículos híbridos e elétricos só irá acelerar essa passagem para o software – os carros elétricos são totalmente controlados por computador. Além disso, automóveis sem motorista controlados por software já estão sendo desenvolvidos pelo Google e pelas principais montadoras de automóveis. A principal varejista do mundo real, a Wal-Mart, tem softwares para controlar seus recursos de logística e distribuição e os usa para derrubar a concorrência. O mesmo acontece com a FedEx, melhor descrita como uma rede de software que por acaso também tem caminhões, aviões e centros de distribuição. E o sucesso ou fracasso das companhias aéreas no presente e no futuro depende de sua capacidade de precificar passagens e otimizar rotas e rendimentos corretamente – usando software. Empresas de petróleo e gás foram as primeiras a inovarem em supercomputação e visualização e análise de dados, elementos cruciais para as atividades de exploração desses recursos no mundo atual. A agricultura também é cada vez mais controlada por software, com análises de solo por satélite vinculadas a algoritmos de seleção de sementes por hectare. A transformação por software da indústria de serviços financeiros nos últimos 30 anos é visível. Praticamente todas as transações financeiras, desde comprar um café até negócios de um trilhão de dólares em derivativos de crédito, são feitas por meio de softwares. E muitos dos principais players de serviços financeiros mais inovadores são empresas de software, como a Square, que possibilita que qualquer pessoa aceite pagamentos com cartão de crédito usando um celular, e a PayPal, que gerou mais de US$ 1 bilhão em receita no segundo trimestre deste ano, uma alta de 31% em relação ao ano anterior. Penso que saúde e educação serão os próximos setores a sofrer uma transformação radical baseada em software. Minha empresa de capital de risco está apoiando startups agressivas nesses dois segmentos tão grandes e cruciais. Acreditamos que esses setores, que historicamente são muito resistentes a mudanças ambiciosas, estão preparados para uma transformação comandada por novos e excelentes empreendedores que focam em software. Até a defesa nacional dos EUA está cada vez mais voltada para software. O soldado de guerra moderno está inserido em uma rede de softwares que fornece orientação nas áreas de inteligência, comunicação, logística e armas. Drones movidos a software lançam ataques aéreos sem colocar pilotos humanos em risco. Agências de inteligência fazem mineração de dados com softwares em larga escala para descobrir e rastrear possíveis planos terroristas. Empresas de todos os setores precisam considerar que a revolução do software está a caminho. Isso inclui até mesmo segmentos que já são baseados em software hoje. Grandes empresas como Oracle e Microsoft estão cada vez mais ameaçadas de irrelevância por novos softwares, como Salesforce.com e Android (ainda mais num mundo onde o Google é dono de uma grande fabricante de celulares). Em alguns setores, principalmente aqueles com forte componente de mundo real, como petróleo e gás, a revolução do software é uma oportunidade para empresas já estabelecidas. Mas em muitos segmentos, novas ideias para softwares acarretarão o surgimento de startups ao estilo do Vale do Silício, que invadem indústrias impunemente. Nos próximos dez anos, as batalhas entre empresas existentes e novos negócios baseados em software serão épicas. Joseph Schumpeter, o economista que cunhou o termo “destruição criativa”, ficaria orgulhoso. E embora quem esteja vendo o valor de seu plano de aposentadoria 401(k) oscilar nas últimas semanas possa duvidar, este é um caso muito positivo para a economia, principalmente nos EUA. Não é por acaso que muitas das grandes novas empresas de tecnologia – inclusive Google, Amazon, eBay, entre outras – são dos EUA. A combinação de excelentes universidades de pesquisa, uma cultura de negócios afeita ao risco, grandes pools de capital próprio em busca de inovação e leis empresariais e contratuais confiáveis não tem paralelo na história e no mundo. Ainda assim, enfrentamos diversos desafios. Primeiro, todas essas novas empresas estão sendo criadas num panorama de enormes adversidades econômicas, o que torna o desafio muito maior do que no período relativamente benéfico dos anos 1990. A boa notícia é que empresas que surgem em tempos como estes e se saem bem tornam-se extremamente fortes e resilientes. E quando a economia finalmente se estabilizar, preste atenção: as melhores novas empresas crescerão em ritmo ainda mais acelerado. Em segundo lugar, muitas pessoas nos EUA e no resto do mundo não têm a educação e as habilidades necessárias para integrar grandes novas empresas que vão surgindo com a revolução do software. É uma tragédia, porque todas as empresas com que trabalho têm uma grande carência de talentos. Engenheiros, gerentes, profissionais de marketing e vendedores de software qualificados do Vale do Silício terão a seu dispor várias ofertas de emprego bem remuneradas e lucrativas sempre que quiserem; enquanto isso, o desemprego e o subemprego nos EUA estão altíssimos. Esse problema é ainda pior do que parece, porque muitos trabalhadores dos setores atuais ficarão perdidos do lado errado da disruptura causada pelo software e talvez nunca mais consigam trabalhar em suas áreas. Não há outro jeito de enfrentar esse problema que não seja a educação, e temos um longo caminho a percorrer. Por fim, as novas empresas têm que provar seu valor. Elas precisam construir culturas fortes, encantar seus clientes, estabelecer suas próprias vantagens competitivas e, sim, justificar suas valorizações. Ninguém deve pressupor que criar uma empresa de alto crescimento baseada em software em um setor já estabelecido seja fácil. A dificuldade é imensa. Tenho o privilégio de trabalhar com algumas das melhores empresas de software da nova geração e posso dizer que elas são muito boas no que fazem. Se atenderem às minhas expectativas e às de outras pessoas, serão negócios fundamentais e de muito valor na economia global, engolindo mercados muito maiores do que a indústria de tecnologia tem sido capaz de conquistar historicamente. Em vez de questionar suas valorizações sem parar, devemos buscar entender como empresas de tecnologia da nova geração estão operando, quais são as consequências mais amplas para os negócios e para a economia e o que podemos fazer coletivamente para aumentar o número de empresas de software inovadoras nos EUA e no resto do mundo. Esta é a grande oportunidade. Eu sei onde estou colocando meu dinheiro. Publicado  originalmente no The Wall Street Journal em 20 de agosto de 2011."}
{"text":"Software is eating the world. More than 10 years after the peak of the 1990s dot-com bubble, a dozen or so new Internet companies like Facebook and Twitter are sparking controversy in Silicon Valley, due to their rapidly growing private market valuations, and even the occasional successful IPO. With scars from the heyday of Webvan and Pets.com still fresh in the investor psyche, people are asking, “Isn’t this just a dangerous new bubble?” I, along with others, have been arguing the other side of the case. (I am co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen-Horowitz, which has invested in Facebook, Groupon, Skype, Twitter, Zynga, and Foursquare, among others. I am also personally an investor in LinkedIn.) We believe that many of the prominent new Internet companies are building real, high-growth, high-margin, highly defensible businesses. Today’s stock market actually hates technology, as shown by all-time low price/earnings ratios for major public technology companies. Apple, for example, has a P/E ratio of around 15.2—about the same as the broader stock market, despite Apple’s immense profitability and dominant market position (Apple in the last couple weeks became the biggest company in America, judged by market capitalization, surpassing Exxon Mobil). And, perhaps most telling, you can’t have a bubble when people are constantly screaming “Bubble!” But too much of the debate is still around financial valuation, as opposed to the underlying intrinsic value of the best of Silicon Valley’s new companies. My own theory is that we are in the middle of a dramatic and broad technological and economic shift in which software companies are poised to take over large swathes of the economy. More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services—from movies to agriculture to national defense. Many of the winners are Silicon Valley-style entrepreneurial technology companies that are invading and overturning established industry structures. Over the next 10 years, I expect many more industries to be disrupted by software, with new world-beating Silicon Valley companies doing the disruption in more cases than not. Why is this happening now? Six decades into the computer revolution, four decades since the invention of the microprocessor, and two decades into the rise of the modern Internet, all of the technology required to transform industries through software finally works and can be widely delivered at global scale. Over two billion people now use the broadband Internet, up from perhaps 50 million a decade ago, when I was at Netscape, the company I co-founded. In the next 10 years, I expect at least five billion people worldwide to own smartphones, giving every individual with such a phone instant access to the full power of the Internet, every moment of every day. On the back end, software programming tools and Internet-based services make it easy to launch new global software-powered start-ups in many industries—without the need to invest in new infrastructure and train new employees. In 2000, when my partner Ben Horowitz was CEO of the first cloud computing company, Loudcloud, the cost of a customer running a basic Internet application was approximately $150,000 a month. Running that same application today in Amazon’s cloud costs about $1,500 a month. With lower start-up costs and a vastly expanded market for online services, the result is a global economy that for the first time will be fully digitally wired—the dream of every cyber-visionary of the early 1990s, finally delivered, a full generation later. Perhaps the single most dramatic example of this phenomenon of software eating a traditional business is the suicide of Borders and corresponding rise of Amazon. In 2001, Borders agreed to hand over its online business to Amazon under the theory that online book sales were non-strategic and unimportant. Today, the world’s largest bookseller, Amazon, is a software company—its core capability is its amazing software engine for selling virtually everything online, no retail stores necessary. On top of that, while Borders was thrashing in the throes of impending bankruptcy, Amazon rearranged its web site to promote its Kindle digital books over physical books for the first time. Now even the books themselves are software. Today’s largest video service by number of subscribers is a software company: Netflix. How Netflix eviscerated Blockbuster is an old story, but now other traditional entertainment providers are facing the same threat. Comcast, Time Warner and others are responding by transforming themselves into software companies with efforts such as TV Everywhere, which liberates content from the physical cable and connects it to smartphones and tablets. Today’s dominant music companies are software companies, too: Apple’s iTunes, Spotify and Pandora. Traditional record labels increasingly exist only to provide those software companies with content. Industry revenue from digital channels totaled $4.6 billion in 2010, growing to 29% of total revenue from 2% in 2004. Today’s fastest growing entertainment companies are videogame makers—again, software—with the industry growing to $60 billion from $30 billion five years ago. And the fastest growing major videogame company is Zynga (maker of games including FarmVille), which delivers its games entirely online. Zynga’s first-quarter revenues grew to $235 million this year, more than double revenues from a year earlier. Rovio, maker of Angry Birds, is expected to clear $100 million in revenue this year (the company was nearly bankrupt when it debuted the popular game on the iPhone in late 2009). Meanwhile, traditional videogame powerhouses like Electronic Arts and Nintendo have seen revenues stagnate and fall. The best new movie production company in many decades, Pixar, was a software company. Disney—Disney!—had to buy Pixar, a software company, to remain relevant in animated movies. Photography, of course, was eaten by software long ago. It’s virtually impossible to buy a mobile phone that doesn’t include a software-powered camera, and photos are uploaded automatically to the Internet for permanent archiving and global sharing. Companies like Shutterfly, Snapfish and Flickr have stepped into Kodak’s place. Today’s largest direct marketing platform is a software company—Google. Now it’s been joined by Groupon, Living Social, Foursquare and others, which are using software to eat the retail marketing industry. Groupon generated over $700 million in revenue in 2010, after being in business for only two years. Today’s fastest growing telecom company is Skype, a software company that was just bought by Microsoft for $8.5 billion. CenturyLink, the third largest telecom company in the U.S., with a $20 billion market cap, had 15 million access lines at the end of June 30—declining at an annual rate of about 7%. Excluding the revenue from its Qwest acquisition, CenturyLink’s revenue from these legacy services declined by more than 11%. Meanwhile, the two biggest telecom companies, AT&T and Verizon, have survived by transforming themselves into software companies, partnering with Apple and other smartphone makers. LinkedIn is today’s fastest growing recruiting company. For the first time ever, on LinkedIn, employees can maintain their own resumes for recruiters to search in real time—giving LinkedIn the opportunity to eat the lucrative $400 billion recruiting industry. Software is also eating much of the value chain of industries that are widely viewed as primarily existing in the physical world. In today’s cars, software runs the engines, controls safety features, entertains passengers, guides drivers to destinations and connects each car to mobile, satellite and GPS networks. The days when a car aficionado could repair his or her own car are long past, due primarily to the high software content. The trend toward hybrid and electric vehicles will only accelerate the software shift—electric cars are completely computer controlled. And the creation of software-powered driverless cars is already under way at Google and the major car companies. Today’s leading real-world retailer, Wal-Mart, uses software to power its logistics and distribution capabilities, which it has used to crush its competition. Likewise for FedEx, which is best thought of as a software network that happens to have trucks, planes and distribution hubs attached. And the success or failure of airlines today and in the future hinges on their ability to price tickets and optimize routes and yields correctly—with software. Oil and gas companies were early innovators in supercomputing and data visualization and analysis, which are crucial to today’s oil and gas exploration efforts. Agriculture is increasingly powered by software as well, including satellite analysis of soils linked to per-acre seed selection software algorithms. The financial services industry has been visibly transformed by software over the last 30 years. Practically every financial transaction, from someone buying a cup of coffee to someone trading a trillion dollars of credit default derivatives, is done in software. And many of the leading innovators in financial services are software companies, such as Square, which allows anyone to accept credit card payments with a mobile phone, and PayPal, which generated more than $1 billion in revenue in the second quarter of this year, up 31% over the previous year. Health care and education, in my view, are next up for fundamental software-based transformation. My venture capital firm is backing aggressive start-ups in both of these gigantic and critical industries. We believe both of these industries, which historically have been highly resistant to entrepreneurial change, are primed for tipping by great new software-centric entrepreneurs. Even national defense is increasingly software-based. The modern combat soldier is embedded in a web of software that provides intelligence, communications, logistics and weapons guidance. Software-powered drones launch airstrikes without putting human pilots at risk. Intelligence agencies do large-scale data mining with software to uncover and track potential terrorist plots. Companies in every industry need to assume that a software revolution is coming. This includes even industries that are software-based today. Great incumbent software companies like Oracle and Microsoft are increasingly threatened with irrelevance by new software offerings like Salesforce.com and Android (especially in a world where Google owns a major handset maker). In some industries, particularly those with a heavy real-world component such as oil and gas, the software revolution is primarily an opportunity for incumbents. But in many industries, new software ideas will result in the rise of new Silicon Valley-style start-ups that invade existing industries with impunity. Over the next 10 years, the battles between incumbents and software-powered insurgents will be epic. Joseph Schumpeter, the economist who coined the term “creative destruction,” would be proud. And while people watching the values of their 401(k)s bounce up and down the last few weeks might doubt it, this is a profoundly positive story for the American economy, in particular. It’s not an accident that many of the biggest recent technology companies—including Google, Amazon, eBay and more—are American companies. Our combination of great research universities, a pro-risk business culture, deep pools of innovation-seeking equity capital and reliable business and contract law is unprecedented and unparalleled in the world. Still, we face several challenges. First of all, every new company today is being built in the face of massive economic headwinds, making the challenge far greater than it was in the relatively benign ’90s. The good news about building a company during times like this is that the companies that do succeed are going to be extremely strong and resilient. And when the economy finally stabilizes, look out—the best of the new companies will grow even faster. Secondly, many people in the U.S. and around the world lack the education and skills required to participate in the great new companies coming out of the software revolution. This is a tragedy since every company I work with is absolutely starved for talent. Qualified software engineers, managers, marketers and salespeople in Silicon Valley can rack up dozens of high-paying, high-upside job offers any time they want, while national unemployment and underemployment is sky high. This problem is even worse than it looks because many workers in existing industries will be stranded on the wrong side of software-based disruption and may never be able to work in their fields again. There’s no way through this problem other than education, and we have a long way to go. Finally, the new companies need to prove their worth. They need to build strong cultures, delight their customers, establish their own competitive advantages and, yes, justify their rising valuations. No one should expect building a new high-growth, software-powered company in an established industry to be easy. It’s brutally difficult. I’m privileged to work with some of the best of the new breed of software companies, and I can tell you they’re really good at what they do. If they perform to my and others’ expectations, they are going to be highly valuable cornerstone companies in the global economy, eating markets far larger than the technology industry has historically been able to pursue. Instead of constantly questioning their valuations, let’s seek to understand how the new generation of technology companies are doing what they do, what the broader consequences are for businesses and the economy and what we can collectively do to expand the number of innovative new software companies created in the U.S. and around the world. That’s the big opportunity. I know where I’m putting my money. Originally published in The Wall Street Journal on August 20, 2011."}

{"text":"Marc Andreessen and Meg Whitman Meg Whitman sat down with Marc Andreessen at a16z’s annual tech summit to talk about the tectonic shifts she is seeing in technology, her job running HP (Andreessen sits on the board), its role as one of the original Silicon Valley heavy-hitters, and what she believes that no one else does. Marc Andreessen: Let’s talk about tech. Let’s play a fill-in-the-blank, you can have as many answers to this as you like. The tech industry is on the verge of _______ ? Meg Whitman: A gigantic revolution on the scale of the mainframe to the client server transition in the enterprise. Andreessen: Why’s that? Whitman: In my view about every ten to fifteen years in our industry there are these huge tectonic plate shifts. You go all the way back to the mainframe to the client server, the client server to Web 1.0, where I had a front seat at the revolution, from Web 1.0 to what I would say is web services and mobile. When these transitions happen, profit pools are in play, competitors come out of nowhere, innovation is at its finest. I think we’re about to go through a huge shift – everything about how technology is bought, how it is consumed, how it’s paid for, how apps are written, how end-users engage with technology. You’ve seen this in the consumer space for some time. When I came to HP all my colleagues said don’t worry about it, you’re used to things moving really fast in the consumer space, but nothing really changes in the enterprise space except over very long periods of time ­– because the install base is so deep and so huge. (For example) the risk of migrating technology at Deutsche Bank is different than what you do in your home life. Anyway, they said, ‘don’t worry you’ll have plenty of time to turnaround the company before anything happens here.’ Well, the change in just my two years at HP around cloud, big data, security is simply remarkable. I feel like it’s moving almost at consumer pace. Look at the success at companies like Salesforce, Workday, Amazon Web Services and frankly our converged cloud and our private cloud system. Andreessen: How on earth did we ever get you to take on the turnaround of a 40,000-person company operating in 170 countries, and $100 billion in revenue? How did we ever possibly talk you into it? Whitman: I ask myself that same question every day. I’ll tell you a little story. After I lost the race for governor (of California) I was reasonably depressed. It’s one of those things where you’re running 100 miles-an-hour, and the day after the election you have nothing to do. Literally you wake up in the morning and you go, ‘OK what am I going to do?’ Around February I was at home at 4 o’clock in the afternoon and my husband, who is a neurosurgeon at Stanford, happened to come home early. And he looked at me, and I was sitting there watching Ellen Degeneres at 4 o’clock in the afternoon. And he goes, ‘Oh, this is not good, this is really not good.’ And just coincidentally almost at that same time, you called me to be on the HP board, on the tech committee. And I said, ‘Great, fantastic, HP’s a great company, 12 minutes from my house, what can go wrong?’ Originally, I was reasonably reluctant, but in the end what happens to companies like HP in my view really matters. This is the grandfather of Silicon Valley. I think it’s really important for the first and second-generation companies to continue to play a real role. It’s important to Silicon Valley and important to California and important to all the communities in which we do business. And it’s an important balance in the industry. In the end that’s why I decided to do it. Andreessen: In the darkest days before you arrived at HP, as many companies do, there was this big voice of the workplace survey. There was an extraordinary phenomenon I found which is unhappiness among the employee base exactly correlated to the following: Employees in the United States, older employees, male employees, white employees. Satisfaction exactly correlated to the opposite: Outside the U.S., young, non-white, and female. HP’s employee base is 70-percent outside the U.S. What’s the process like to have that scope of talent, how much international talent are we finding? How are the good people surfacing? Whitman: I would say that one of our big benefits is the reputation of HP outside of the United States is really quite pristine. The farther you get from Palo Alto, they didn’t read about the board drama. You go to China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, Russia, people still kill to work at HP. We have an incredible pipeline of young kids and early career people who are really talented. I will take our India team and put them up against anyone, it is really remarkable. Actually what we’re trying to do now is bring some of those people to Palo Alto to repopulate some of the things that must be here in California. I have to say we’re really fascinated by what’s going on in Shenzhen, China. What’s happening there is the ODMs — people who make the devices for us, who manufacturer for us, laptops and other things — are run by young people. There’s a whole new ecosystem there. The reason why there are thousands of thousands of consumer tablets for $49 on any major website at any major retailer is because of what’s going on in Shenzhen. One of the people we met and do business with is a company called BYD, and run by an incredibly dynamic young Chinese guy. The acronym stands for Build Your Dream, and that’s what they are about. It’s so reminiscent of Silicon Valley, it’s just incredible. The next century, we have to be so cognizant of what’s happening in Asia. Andreessen: Before you took on this role you had a very exciting run at the governor’s office in California. What lessons did you take away from the experience running for governor of California, and are any of those lessons ones you can apply to what you’re doing now? Whitman: I didn’t think there was going to be much relevance to running for public office and running HP. But surprisingly sometimes things happen for a reason, and a lot of what I went through running for governor has been extraordinarily valuable for me. What you learn when you’re running for public office is that it’s one brutal rough and tumble game. And there are no results until the end, so journalism is opinion journalism, and the stuff they say about you is simply remarkable. The stuff that happens is beyond what most people can take. So I show up at HP really quite bruised, but what I hadn’t realized was how tough I had become. The stuff that happened in my first year, the Autonomy write-down, the EDS write-down, missing plans by huge amounts; we were rolling from prices to prices. And I have to say, nothing really bothered me. I now have such a high bar. If they’re not attacking you, not attacking your children, not questioning your character, it’s all good. It has given me a sense of calmness that I think has been very good for HP, because everyone takes their cues from their leaders. I’ve been kind of like, ‘alright, this is all going to be just fine.’ Andreessen: What do you believe that nobody else does? Whitman: I do not think PCs are dead. Listen, my view is that PCs may not exist in the exact form factor they are in today. But all of you know that people at work actually have to do real work. The ability to create, to consume, and to share is actually going up dramatically. The desire for compute is going up dramatically. I think there is a spectrum of personal compute from workstations to desktops to laptops to hybrids to tablets to smartphones. My view is at least for the next five to ten years, there are going to be people who want to be able do real work, real productivity, who are going to need more than a smartphone or a tablet. We’re investing (against that). There are pockets of growth there. We obviously have to get better at anticipating new form factors and new consumption models. PC as a service is coming our way, but I don’t think the form factor is dead."}
{"text":"In a lot of ways, the key to what we do as investors is timing. I think the ideas are often obvious. I think actually the ideas are often tried many times in a row before they ultimately work. Take pen computing. When I got to the Valley all the VCs had just gotten their heads handed to them on pen computing, including Apple with the Newton. The Newton in 1989 and the iPad in 2009 are essentially the same product just 20 years later, with 20 years of advances in software and hardware, but the same basic product. A lot of very smart people though the Newton was going to be it. They thought the time was right in 1989, and a lot of people were super-skeptical as a result in 2009 when it came around again. But the idea was obvious. In fact, Apple took a Newton TV commercial from 1989, it was sort of an inside joke at Apple, and re-shot it frame for frame, word for word for an iPad commercial 20 years later. It’s the same thing. You knew the tablet was coming, people knew the smartphone was coming for a very long time. AI (artificial intelligence) people knew machine learning was going to take hold, social networking research has been going on for decades. In my own work, the web drew on 30 years of work in interactive computing, hypertext and online libraries. I think most of the big breakthroughs in the next 20 years already exist, they are already running in labs. You watch that all evolve, you watch people try and fail to commercialize it and fail. And you try to zero-in on a few things: – When is the really right time for this thing to happen? – When has the technology really reached the point where it actually works? – And there is a sociological component, which is, when is the world ready for the new idea? – And the psychological component, what will the reaction of customer No. 1 actually be? Either, “Wow, this is great!” or “I thought this would work, but I am actually going to throw this in my closet.” Like everyone did with the Newton. – There is the people question of course, who is going to be the person and the team that are going to catalyze the company and bring the idea into the form of a commercial product? And again, using these signals, this data, you try and figure out the timing, which is the key to the success or failure of almost all this stuff. I am firmly convinced that invention in something that happens over long periods of time, by lots of very smart people, playing each others’ ideas against each other. I think there are very few eureka moments, very few genuinely new ideas. It’s the process of combination of lots and lots of smart people working the field over a very long period of time. And then it catalyzes, and that is where the magic is, and where the most fun part of this is. That magic moment when it all comes together. And the great thing about being in the venture capital is, if it fails, we’ll try the same thing five years later. Almost certainly with new people, because the previous people will be too traumatized to try it again."}
{"text":"This article was originally published in The New York Times on January 21, 2014. NYT editor’s note: Marc Andreessen’s venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, has invested just under $50 million in Bitcoin-related start-ups. The firm is actively searching for more Bitcoin-based investment opportunities. He does not personally own more than a de minimis amount of Bitcoin. A mysterious new technology emerges, seemingly out of nowhere, but actually the result of two decades of intense research and development by nearly anonymous researchers. Political idealists project visions of liberation and revolution onto it; establishment elites heap contempt and scorn on it. On the other hand, technologists –- nerds — are transfixed by it. They see within it enormous potential and spend their nights and weekends tinkering with it. Eventually mainstream products, companies and industries emerge to commercialize it; its effects become profound; and later, many people wonder why its powerful promise wasn’t more obvious from the start. What technology am I talking about? Personal computers in 1975, the Internet in 1993, and — I believe — Bitcoin in 2014. One can hardly accuse Bitcoin of being an uncovered topic, yet the gulf between what the press and many regular people believe Bitcoin is, and what a growing critical mass of technologists believe Bitcoin is, remains enormous. In this post, I will explain why Bitcoin has so many Silicon Valley programmers and entrepreneurs all lathered up, and what I think Bitcoin’s future potential is. First, Bitcoin at its most fundamental level is a breakthrough in computer science – one that builds on 20 years of research into cryptographic currency, and 40 years of research in cryptography, by thousands of researchers around the world. Bitcoin is the first practical solution to a longstanding problem in computer science called the Byzantine Generals Problem. To quote from the original paper defining the B.G.P.: “[Imagine] a group of generals of the Byzantine army camped with their troops around an enemy city. Communicating only by messenger, the generals must agree upon a common battle plan. However, one or more of them may be traitors who will try to confuse the others. The problem is to find an algorithm to ensure that the loyal generals will reach agreement.” More generally, the B.G.P. poses the question of how to establish trust between otherwise unrelated parties over an untrusted network like the Internet. The practical consequence of solving this problem is that Bitcoin gives us, for the first time, a way for one Internet user to transfer a unique piece of digital property to another Internet user, such that the transfer is guaranteed to be safe and secure, everyone knows that the transfer has taken place, and nobody can challenge the legitimacy of the transfer. The consequences of this breakthrough are hard to overstate. What kinds of digital property might be transferred in this way? Think about digital signatures, digital contracts, digital keys (to physical locks, or to online lockers), digital ownership of physical assets such as cars and houses, digital stocks and bonds … and digital money. All these are exchanged through a distributed network of trust that does not require or rely upon a central intermediary like a bank or broker. And all in a way where only the owner of an asset can send it, only the intended recipient can receive it, the asset can only exist in one place at a time, and everyone can validate transactions and ownership of all assets anytime they want. Bitcoin is an Internet-wide distributed ledger. You buy into the ledger by purchasing one of a fixed number of slots, either with cash or by selling a product and service for Bitcoin. You sell out of the ledger by trading your Bitcoin to someone else who wants to buy into the ledger. Anyone in the world can buy into or sell out of the ledger any time they want – with no approval needed, and with no or very low fees. The Bitcoin “coins” themselves are simply slots in the ledger, analogous in some ways to seats on a stock exchange, except much more broadly applicable to real world transactions. The Bitcoin ledger is a new kind of payment system. Anyone in the world can pay anyone else in the world any amount of value of Bitcoin by simply transferring ownership of the corresponding slot in the ledger. Put value in, transfer it, the recipient gets value out, no authorization required, and in many cases, no fees. That last part is enormously important. Bitcoin is the first Internetwide payment system where transactions either happen with no fees or very low fees (down to fractions of pennies). Existing payment systems charge fees of about 2 to 3 percent – and that’s in the developed world. In lots of other places, there either are no modern payment systems or the rates are significantly higher. We’ll come back to that. Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument. It is a way to exchange money or assets between parties with no pre-existing trust: A string of numbers is sent over email or text message in the simplest case. The sender doesn’t need to know or trust the receiver or vice versa. Related, there are no chargebacks — this is the part that is literally like cash – if you have the money or the asset, you can pay with it; if you don’t, you can’t. This is brand new. This has never existed in digital form before. Bitcoin is a digital currency, whose value is based directly on two things: use of the payment system today – volume and velocity of payments running through the ledger – and speculation on future use of the payment system. This is one part that is confusing people. It’s not as much that the Bitcoin currency has some arbitrary value and then people are trading with it; it’s more that people can trade with Bitcoin (anywhere, everywhere, with no fraud and no or very low fees) and as a result it has value. It is perhaps true right at this moment that the value of Bitcoin currency is based more on speculation than actual payment volume, but it is equally true that that speculation is establishing a sufficiently high price for the currency that payments have become practically possible. The Bitcoin currency had to be worth something before it could bear any amount of real-world payment volume. This is the classic “chicken and egg” problem with new technology: new technology is not worth much until it’s worth a lot. And so the fact that Bitcoin has risen in value in part because of speculation is making the reality of its usefulness arrive much faster than it would have otherwise. Critics of Bitcoin point to limited usage by ordinary consumers and merchants, but that same criticism was leveled against PCs and the Internet at the same stage. Every day, more and more consumers and merchants are buying, using and selling Bitcoin, all around the world. The overall numbers are still small, but they are growing quickly. And ease of use for all participants is rapidly increasing as Bitcoin tools and technologies are improved. Remember, it used to be technically challenging to even get on the Internet. Now it’s not. The criticism that merchants will not accept Bitcoin because of its volatility is also incorrect. Bitcoin can be used entirely as a payment system; merchants do not need to hold any Bitcoin currency or be exposed to Bitcoin volatility at any time. Any consumer or merchant can trade in and out of Bitcoin and other currencies any time they want. Why would any merchant — online or in the real world — want to accept Bitcoin as payment, given the currently small number of consumers who want to pay with it? My partner Chris Dixon recently gave this example: “Let’s say you sell electronics online. Profit margins in those businesses are usually under 5 percent, which means conventional 2.5 percent payment fees consume half the margin. That’s money that could be reinvested in the business, passed back to consumers or taxed by the government. Of all of those choices, handing 2.5 percent to banks to move bits around the Internet is the worst possible choice. Another challenge merchants have with payments is accepting international payments. If you are wondering why your favorite product or service isn’t available in your country, the answer is often payments.” In addition, merchants are highly attracted to Bitcoin because it eliminates the risk of credit card fraud. This is the form of fraud that motivates so many criminals to put so much work into stealing personal customer information and credit card numbers. Since Bitcoin is a digital bearer instrument, the receiver of a payment does not get any information from the sender that can be used to steal money from the sender in the future, either by that merchant or by a criminal who steals that information from the merchant. Credit card fraud is such a big deal for merchants, credit card processors and banks that online fraud detection systems are hair-trigger wired to stop transactions that look even slightly suspicious, whether or not they are actually fraudulent. As a result, many online merchants are forced to turn away 5 to 10 percent of incoming orders that they could take without fear if the customers were paying with Bitcoin, where such fraud would not be possible. Since these are orders that were coming in already, they are inherently the highest margin orders a merchant can get, and so being able to take them will drastically increase many merchants’ profit margins. Bitcoin’s antifraud properties even extend into the physical world of retail stores and shoppers. For example, with Bitcoin, the huge hack that recently stole 70 million consumers’ credit card information from the Target department store chain would not have been possible. Here’s how that would work: You fill your cart and go to the checkout station like you do now. But instead of handing over your credit card to pay, you pull out your smartphone and take a snapshot of a QR code displayed by the cash register. The QR code contains all the information required for you to send Bitcoin to Target, including the amount. You click “Confirm” on your phone and the transaction is done (including converting dollars from your account into Bitcoin, if you did not own any Bitcoin). Target is happy because it has the money in the form of Bitcoin, which it can immediately turn into dollars if it wants, and it paid no or very low payment processing fees; you are happy because there is no way for hackers to steal any of your personal information; and organized crime is unhappy. (Well, maybe criminals are still happy: They can try to steal money directly from poorly-secured merchant computer systems. But even if they succeed, consumers bear no risk of loss, fraud or identity theft.) Finally, I’d like to address the claim made by some critics that Bitcoin is a haven for bad behavior, for criminals and terrorists to transfer money anonymously with impunity. This is a myth, fostered mostly by sensationalistic press coverage and an incomplete understanding of the technology. Much like email, which is quite traceable, Bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous. Further, every transaction in the Bitcoin network is tracked and logged forever in the Bitcoin blockchain, or permanent record, available for all to see. As a result, Bitcoin is considerably easier for law enforcement to trace than cash, gold or diamonds. What’s the future of Bitcoin? Bitcoin is a classic network effect, a positive feedback loop. The more people who use Bitcoin, the more valuable Bitcoin is for everyone who uses it, and the higher the incentive for the next user to start using the technology. Bitcoin shares this network effect property with the telephone system, the web, and popular Internet services like eBay and Facebook. In fact, Bitcoin is a four-sided network effect. There are four constituencies that participate in expanding the value of Bitcoin as a consequence of their own self-interested participation. Those constituencies are (1) consumers who pay with Bitcoin, (2) merchants who accept Bitcoin, (3) “miners” who run the computers that process and validate all the transactions and enable the distributed trust network to exist, and (4) developers and entrepreneurs who are building new products and services with and on top of Bitcoin. All four sides of the network effect are playing a valuable part in expanding the value of the overall system, but the fourth is particularly important. All over Silicon Valley and around the world, many thousands of programmers are using Bitcoin as a building block for a kaleidoscope of new product and service ideas that were not possible before. And at our venture capital firm, Andreessen Horowitz, we are seeing a rapidly increasing number of outstanding entrepreneurs – not a few with highly respected track records in the financial industry – building companies on top of Bitcoin. For this reason alone, new challengers to Bitcoin face a hard uphill battle. If something is to displace Bitcoin now, it will have to have sizable improvements and it will have to happen quickly. Otherwise, this network effect will carry Bitcoin to dominance. One immediately obvious and enormous area for Bitcoin-based innovation is international remittance. Every day, hundreds of millions of low-income people go to work in hard jobs in foreign countries to make money to send back to their families in their home countries – over $400 billion in total annually, according to the World Bank. Every day, banks and payment companies extract mind-boggling fees, up to 10 percent and sometimes even higher, to send this money. Switching to Bitcoin, which charges no or very low fees, for these remittance payments will therefore raise the quality of life of migrant workers and their families significantly. In fact, it is hard to think of any one thing that would have a faster and more positive effect on so many people in the world’s poorest countries. Moreover, Bitcoin generally can be a powerful force to bring a much larger number of people around the world into the modern economic system. Only about 20 countries around the world have what we would consider to be fully modern banking and payment systems; the other roughly 175 have a long way to go. As a result, many people in many countries are excluded from products and services that we in the West take for granted. Even Netflix, a completely virtual service, is only available in about 40 countries. Bitcoin, as a global payment system anyone can use from anywhere at any time, can be a powerful catalyst to extend the benefits of the modern economic system to virtually everyone on the planet. And even here in the United States, a long-recognized problem is the extremely high fees that the “unbanked” — people without conventional bank accounts — pay for even basic financial services. Bitcoin can be used to go straight at that problem, by making it easy to offer extremely low-fee services to people outside of the traditional financial system. A third fascinating use case for Bitcoin is micropayments, or ultrasmall payments. Micropayments have never been feasible, despite 20 years of attempts, because it is not cost effective to run small payments (think $1 and below, down to pennies or fractions of a penny) through the existing credit/debit and banking systems. The fee structure of those systems makes that nonviable. All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, that’s trivially easy. Bitcoins have the nifty property of infinite divisibility: currently down to eight decimal places after the dot, but more in the future. So you can specify an arbitrarily small amount of money, like a thousandth of a penny, and send it to anyone in the world for free or near-free. Think about content monetization, for example. One reason media businesses such as newspapers struggle to charge for content is because they need to charge either all (pay the entire subscription fee for all the content) or nothing (which then results in all those terrible banner ads everywhere on the web). All of a sudden, with Bitcoin, there is an economically viable way to charge arbitrarily small amounts of money per article, or per section, or per hour, or per video play, or per archive access, or per news alert. Another potential use of Bitcoin micropayments is to fight spam. Future email systems and social networks could refuse to accept incoming messages unless they were accompanied with tiny amounts of Bitcoin — tiny enough to not matter to the sender, but large enough to deter spammers, who today can send uncounted billions of spam messages for free with impunity. Finally, a fourth interesting use case is public payments. This idea first came to my attention in a news article a few months ago. A random spectator at a televised sports event held up a placard with a QR code and the text “Send me Bitcoin!” He received $25,000 in Bitcoin in the first 24 hours, all from people he had never met. This was the first time in history that you could see someone holding up a sign, in person or on TV or in a photo, and then send them money with two clicks on your smartphone: take the photo of the QR code on the sign, and click to send the money. Think about the implications for protest movements. Today protesters want to get on TV so people learn about their cause. Tomorrow they’ll want to get on TV because that’s how they’ll raise money, by literally holding up signs that let people anywhere in the world who sympathize with them send them money on the spot. Bitcoin is a financial technology dream come true for even the most hardened anticapitalist political organizer. The coming years will be a period of great drama and excitement revolving around this new technology. For example, some prominent economists are deeply skeptical of Bitcoin, even though Ben S. Bernanke, formerly Federal Reserve chairman, recently wrote that digital currencies like Bitcoin “may hold long-term promise, particularly if they promote a faster, more secure and more efficient payment system.” And in 1999, the legendary economist Milton Friedman said: “One thing that’s missing but will soon be developed is a reliable e-cash, a method whereby on the Internet you can transfer funds from A to B without A knowing B or B knowing A – the way I can take a $20 bill and hand it over to you, and you may get that without knowing who I am.” Economists who attack Bitcoin today might be correct, but I’m with Ben and Milton. Further, there is no shortage of regulatory topics and issues that will have to be addressed, since almost no country’s regulatory framework for banking and payments anticipated a technology like Bitcoin. But I hope that I have given you a sense of the enormous promise of Bitcoin. Far from a mere libertarian fairy tale or a simple Silicon Valley exercise in hype, Bitcoin offers a sweeping vista of opportunity to reimagine how the financial system can and should work in the Internet era, and a catalyst to reshape that system in ways that are more powerful for individuals and businesses alike."}
{"text":"One of the interesting things I have seen, especially in the last 10 years, is that many of the big winners in technology have been what I call “mission-driven” versus “mercenary-driven” companies. There are a lot of companies that cut corners. There are a lot of companies that have a mercenary outlook, and will dump their idealistic goal to make a business work in the short-term. We steer clear of those. We are looking for the companies who are going to be the big winners because they are going to cause a fundamental change in the world, as opposed to making a short-term grab for revenue or a short-term grab for an acquisition. These are the founders who come in to the firm and say, “Look, I don’t care whether I make money or not, that’s not my goal. I want to change the world in the following way. I have this mission…” As Steve Jobs used to say, “I want to make a ding in the universe. I want to make beautiful products that people love.” Or Mark Zuckerberg: “I want to make the world more open and connected.” Or Larry Page and Sergey Brin: “I want to index the world’s information.” How they will make money is typically not part of the conversation. These companies, and Google is a great example, usually have no business model. There is this vague notion of generating revenue. So you always wonder with your investor hat on, “Am I funding a social mission or am I funding a company? What’s going on here? Will they make compromises so fatal in the direction of pure ideology that they won’t actually ever build a business?” But the pattern at the moment is the stronger the ideology or mission of the company, the more successful the company. I think a lot of that has to do with recruiting. A lot of the best people in the field don’t want to just work for money. Let’s say you are founder of a company, and you are competing with 1,000 other founders to hire the smartest people coming out of the best universities. If you go in with a pitch that says, “You are going to make $120,000 a year, come work for us,” that is not as effective as, “You are going to change the world, and oh, by the way, you are going to make $120,000 a year.” So mission-driven companies seem to have a gigantic leg-up in recruiting, and that ripples through to morale and ultimately to retention. Conversely, the purely mercenary startups we see, they generally don’t go well. They aren’t able to get good people, and don’t end up having a message that can punch through the noise. They don’t tend to go anywhere. The Machiavellian view on this is if you are the founder you actually want to pretend you have a huge ideological mission, even if you don’t. And I guess you would rather do that, than not have one, but clearly it helps enormously to have a real mission."}
{"text":"I am more bullish about the future of the news industry over the next 20 years than almost anyone I know. You are going to see it grow 10X to 100X from where it is today. That is my starting point for any discussion about the future of journalism. Here’s why I believe it, and how we will get there. Journalism has changed There has been a fascinating change in the traditional journalistic press over the last several years. Take corrections as an example. It used to be that corrections to printed news stories were a really big deal. There was a high bar to get a correction accepted in a newspaper or magazine. The story as printed was the permanent record. Now, even top print newspapers and magazines frequently revise stories online, sometimes dozens of times, often without tracking changes or acknowledging a change has been made. There are two ways to view this. The glass-half-full-view is that stories get better and better over time, vectoring ever closer to the truth. As a result, overall accuracy goes up over time. That is good for publications and journalists, and also good for their subjects. The glass-half-empty-view is that the quality bar for an initial post can be lower. Sloppy stories get published since they can always be corrected later, as much or as often as needed. This gets us into deterministic “truth” versus probabilistic “truth” territory. In other words, from: Here it is, take it or leave it, to: Here it is, subject to arbitrary ongoing revision. For better or worse (and maybe both), print journalism is converging in technique and quality towards blogs and Wikipedia. Ed Bott fully decoded this with his original NSA PRISM news stories. Given that change, and the easy slide into probabilistic “truth,” I am very interested to see how Journalism with a capital J can maintain its reputation for truth and accuracy versus upstart blogs and Wikipedia. For Journalism  – big J – the stakes  are very high if that reputation is lost. But it may be that all journalism wins. Maybe we are entering into a new golden age of journalism, and we just haven’t recognized it yet.  We can have the best of all worlds, with both accuracy rising, and stories that hew closer to truth. The news business should be run like a business The news business is a business like any business. It can and should be analyzed and run like a business. Thinking of news as a business is not only NOT bad for quality, objective journalism, but is PRO quality, objective journalism. A healthy business is the foundation for being able to build high quality products, and to do so sustainably. That includes journalism. Analyzed as a business, the news industry is going through a fundamental restructuring and transformation, for worse and for better. The main change is that news businesses from 1946-2005 were mostly monopolies and oligopolies. Now they aren’t. The monopoly/oligopoly structure of newspapers, magazines, and broadcast TV news pre-‘05 meant restricted choice and overly high prices. In other words, the key to the old businesses was control of distribution, way more than anyone ever wanted to admit. That’s wonderful while it lasts, but wrenching when that control goes away. The end of monopolistic control doesn’t mean that great news businesses can’t get built in highly competitive markets. They just get built differently than before. Now, with everyone on Internet, three things are happening simultaneously: 1. Distribution is going from locked down to completely open, anyone can create and distribute. There is no monetary premium for control of distribution. 2. Formerly separate industries are colliding on the Internet. It’s newspaper vs. magazine vs. broadcast TV vs. cable TV vs. wire service. Now they all compete. Both No. 1 and No. 2 drive prices down. 3. At the same time, the market size is dramatically expanding—many more people consume news now vs. 10 or 20 years ago. Many more still will consume news in the next 10 to 20 years. Volume is being driven up, and that is a big, big deal. Right now everyone is obsessed with slumping prices, but ultimately, the most important dynamic is No. 3 – increasing volume. Here’s why: Market size equals destiny. The big opportunity for the news industry in the next five to 10 years is to increase its market size 100x AND drop prices 10X. Become larger and much more important in the process. Some of the best news about the news business is the gigantic expansion of the addressable market, a function of the rise of the developing world plus the Internet. So how big is it? If you extrapolate from the number of smartphones globally, the total addressable market for news by 2020 is around 5 billion people worldwide. However, we all have to get more sophisticated about defining and segmenting markets. It is critical to really understand the who, where, when, and why to serve that massive market effectively. For example, many evolving markets are seeing the “death of the middle.” The winners in these markets either offer the broadest breadth or the deepest depth. In evolving markets neither the broadest nor deepest is in trouble, but the middle market is withering. So it is logical to expect the big winners in the news business to either be the broadest or the deepest: To go maximum mass, or maximum specific. With that as a backdrop, here are eight obvious business models for news now, and in the future. This isn’t a pick one model and stick with it prospect, news businesses should mix and match as relevant. Advertising: Advertising is still central for many news businesses. But they need to get out of the “race to bottom” dynamic of bad content, bad advertisers, and bad ads. Quality journalism businesses need to either take responsibility for their own high-quality advertisers and ads, or work with partners who do. There is no excuse for crappy network-served teeth whitening come-ons and one weird trick ads served against high quality content. Disastrous. Subscriptions: Many consumers pay money for things they value much of the time. If they’re unwilling to pay for a news product, it begs the question, are they really valuing it? Premium content: A paid tier on top of free, ad-supported content. This goes after the high-end news junkies reading the likes of Bloomberg & Reuters. It will work for more and more new outlets. Again, value equals people paying money for something. Conferences and events: Bits are increasingly abundant, and human presence is becoming scarce. So charge for that scarcity, and use bits to drive demand for human presence. Cross-media: Tina Brown was right but too early with Talk. News is a key source of material for books, TV, and film—which happen also to be growth businesses. Crowdfunding: This is a GIGANTIC opportunity especially for investigative journalism. Match people with interest in a topic to the reporters on the ground telling the stories. Click = vote = $. (Helpful hint: Start today with Crowdtilt. Easy-as-pie.) Bitcoin for micropayments: Easy to get started now (checkout Coinbase). As the consumer use of Bitcoin scales up for transactions, it becomes easy to ask for small amounts of money on a per-story or per-view basis with low or no fees. (A lot more of my thinking on the subject of Bitcoin here.) Philanthropy: Today the examples are Pro Publica and First Look Media, tomorrow the could be many more examples. There is around $300 billion per year in philanthropic activity in the U.S. alone. It’s WAY underutilized in the news business. If we look at the specific example of investigative journalism, believed to be least commercially viable type or news, you start to see how these models can play together. The so-called “investigative journalism problem” is straightforward: How does it get funded in this new world? I have two responses. The first is that the total global expense budget of all investigative journalism is tiny —  in the neighborhood of tens of millions of dollars annually. That’s the good news, small money problems are easier to solve than big money nightmares. How we might solve this small money problem is via a combination of crowdfunding, philanthropy and subsidization by otherwise healthy news businesses. The combination should easily cover the global tab of investigative journalism, and even increase the money available.  The same solution can address the “Baghdad bureau problem.” Conflict-zone reporting of all kinds is super-important, and relative to other kinds of reporting, expensive, but again, it’s not much money in total. A last thought on business models. As my friend Jim Barksdale says, “There are two ways to make money in business: You can unbundle, or you can bundle.” Or, rebundle. We already see the rise of new kinds of news aggregators in the wake of the great unbundling of newspapers and magazines. This is another thread to pull on. As business models get re-engineered and this brave new world of news comes to pass, there is this fear that oceans of crap will drive out quality content. I don’t think that happens. In fact, I believe the opposite will occur. On the Internet, there is no limitation to the number of outlets or voices in the news chorus. Therefore, quality can easily coexist with crap. All can thrive in their respective markets. And, the more noise, confusion, and crap — the more there is an increase of, and corresponding need for, trusted guides, respected experts, and quality brands. Remember: Most great businesses are not big businesses. This market is plenty big enough for thousands of high-margin, small to medium-sized businesses. Growing fast with quality. People and companies that are doing it right. The following are some examples (in alphabetical order). There are many others, and I would encourage additions. Not every experiment will work, and maybe even some of these won’t work. That’s not the point. Experiments are needed for creation, and ultimately success – especially in the news business. AnandTech: Monstrously competent technical coverage of the computing industry. Anand’s team provides unprecedented depth and detail. As a result, it wields big influence in industry. The Atlantic: Bob Cohn is taking a long-lived and respected brand, and blowing it out worldwide. The Atlantic is a daily presence now, and has a growing audience thanks to digital distribution. Buzzfeed: Jonah Peretti built the Buzzfeed fire hose with listicles. He’s leveraging that to do amazing in-depth long-form journalism. And growing like a banshee. The Guardian: The Guardian is a  particularly great example of print crossing into online. Thanks to digital the Guardian brand is more global and reaches more readers than ever before. Politico: The political junkie’s favorite place on the Internet. Politico has taken over as the first thing D.C. reads every morning. It demonstrates the virtues of aggressive focus online. Search Engine Land: Danny Sullivan has created a place for all the search news, all the time. He’s leveraged all those interesting bits into live events and even lead generation. It’s  a new model for a digital news business. The Verge: Josh Topolsky and his crew provide full coverage of tech industry news. It’s become a daily must-read for both in-the weeds tech folks and consumer audiences. Expect Verge and its parent Vox to be 10X larger in the next five years. Vice: From online Do’s and Don’ts, and now to the Vice media empire. Vice shifted from print to rapid growth and increasing presence via online stories and especially video. Wirecutter: A mini gadget news empire skippered by Brian Lam from various beachside locales. Lam is pioneering a new style of tech journalism, a side effect of which is great data. Wired: Scott Dadich and the Wired gang are blending print and digital with amazing breadth and depth. More than half of revenue comes from digital, and it’s growing. I’ll also highlight three personal investments of mine, all growing fast with quality: Talking Points Memo led by Josh Marshall. Henry Blodget and Business Insider. Sarah Lacy and PandoDaily. A hat tip to the new entrants from tech and their massive investment in the future of news. Jeff Bezos and his $250 million purchase of The Washington Post. Pierre Omidyar and his $250 million commitment First Look Media, and their first digital magazine The Intercept. And finally, The New York Times. It’s great to great to see The Times has evidently cracked code on the transition from print to digital after extremely hard effort. What’s holding the future of news back There are some artifacts and ideas in the journalism business that arguably are  counterproductive to the growth of both quality journalism and quality businesses. It’s why some organizations are finding it so hard to move forward. An obvious one is the bloated cost structure left over from the news industry’s monopoly/oligopoly days. Nobody promised every news outfit a shiny headquarters tower, big expense accounts, and lots of secretaries! Unions and pensions are another holdover. Both were useful once, but now impose a structural rigidity in a rapidly changing environment. They make it hard to respond to a changing financial environment and to nimbler competition. The better model for incentivizing employees is sharing equity in the company. Those are the key structural issues holding some news businesses back, but there is an approach to how the news is created that also prevents progress. It’s the notion that “objectivity” is the only model worth pursuing. The practice of  gathering all sides of an issue, and keeping an editorial voice out of it is still relevant for some, but the broad journalism opportunity includes many variations of subjectivity. Pre-World War II, subjectivity was the dominant model in the news business – lots of points of view battling it out in marketplace of ideas. As with people and opinions, there were many approaches to writing or broadcasting  on the same topic. My take is that the rise of objectivity journalism post-World War II was an artifact of the new monopoly/oligopoly structures news organizations had constructed for themselves. Introducing so-called objective news coverage was necessary to ward off antitrust allegations, and ultimately, reporters embraced it. So it stuck. But the objective approach is only one way to tell stories and get at truth. Many stories don’t have “two sides.” Indeed, presenting an event or an issue with a point of view can have even more impact, and reach an audience otherwise left out of the conversation. The opportunity for leadership in the journalism business, just happens to be same leadership opportunity as in all businesses. Leaders just need to start leading. One start would be to tear down, or at least modify the “Chinese wall” between content and the business side. No other non-monopoly industry lets product creators off the hook on how the business works. Before the journalistic purists burst a fountain pen, consider that there are intermediate points between “holier than holy” and “hopelessly corrupt” when it comes to editorial content. Paying attention to the business doesn’t equal warped coverage. It does equal a growing business. There are many businesses that balance incentives and conflicts all day long. Those businesses are able to hold the line on quality, and make great products. The point is, there isn’t just one way, but ought to be many ways to skin the cat in news. All of this requires abandoning the past, something that admittedly is very hard but necessary to move forward. Today’s news organizations are spending 90% of their effort and resources on playing defense. They are protecting the old artifacts and business model, rather than going on the offense and making the future. Even newspapers and other media outlets that are just now making it across the digital chasm would be much better off today if leadership had shifted resources and focus harder and sooner. Without a strong offense, and a view forward rather than back, a bad result is inevitable in the long run. The best approach is to think like a 100% owner of your company with long-term time horizon. Then you work backward to the present and see what makes sense and what remains. Versus, here is what we have now, how do we carry it forward? That is a tough exercise, and an even tougher mind shift. As we have already seen in the demise of scads of newspapers and other periodicals, not every news organization will make it. And that is OK. Further consolidation will be required. The U.S. alone has 15 full-scale national news organizations, plus more from international markets and all the online news organizations cropping up, That’s too many general news outfits. The good news is those that would survive and thrive are in control of their own destiny. The challenges and opportunities that these news businesses face can be rethought, addressed, and fixed. It’s similar to what any successful business goes through. The guidelines and the characteristics for winning are the same. It requires the following. Vision: The difference between vision and hallucination is others can see vision. It is critical to articulate a bright future with clarity that everyone can see. Scrappiness: Tough challenges call for resourcefulness and pragmatism. You need to stay close to the ground, wallowing in every detail and all over any opportunity that arises. Experimentation: You may not have all the right answers up front, but running many experiments changes the battle for the right way forward from arguments to tests. You get data, which leads to correctness and ultimately finding the right answers. Adaptability: Ask yourself, would you rather be right or successful? That needs to be top of mind at all times because times change and we change. You want strong views weakly held. Focus: Once you gain clarity from experiments and adaptation, then it’s time to focus on a small number of ultra-clear goals. When those are defined then it’s all-hands-on-deck. Deferral of gratification: You need the stomach (and resources!) to reject near-term rewards for enduring success. In journalism this means refusing to participate in the race to the bottom. An entrepreneurial mindset: This is true both for new companies and existing companies. It’s a bit of a mantra. We own the company. We make the business. We control our future. It’s on us. Remember, I am very bullish on the future of the news business. But as Tommy Lasorda said:  “Nobody said this fucking job would be all that fucking easy.” But while hard, it can be done, and it is worth doing."}
{"text":"Photo: Patrick Nouhailler/ Flickr The popular recipe for creating the “next” Silicon Valley goes something like this: *Build a big, beautiful, fully equipped technology park; *Mix in R&D labs and university centers; *Provide incentives to attract scientists, firms, and users; *Interconnect the industry through consortia and specialized suppliers; *Protect intellectual property and tech transfer; and *Establish a favorable business environment and regulations. Except … this approach to innovation clusters hasn’t really worked. Some have even dismissed these government-driven efforts as “modern-day snake oil.” Yet policymakers are always searching for the next Silicon Valley because of the critical link between tech innovation, economic growth, and social opportunity. Previous efforts at such clusters failed for a variety of reasons, but one big reason is that government efforts alone simply don’t draw people. That’s why a recent crop of experiments has focused more on building entrepreneurial communities, urban hubs and districts, and hackerspaces. Still, we’re “splitting the logic” on how to create an innovation ecosystem, according to MIT expert Fiona Murray in Technology Review: We’re either going top-down by focusing primarily on infrastructure — plunking down an office park next to a university — or bottom-up by focusing on just the networks. None of these efforts successfully pursue both paths at once, with government, academia and entrepreneurial communities proceeding together in lockstep … as was the case in the development of Silicon Valley. But policymakers shouldn’t be trying to copy Silicon Valley. Instead, they should be figuring out what domain is (or could be) specific to their region — and then removing the regulatory hurdles for that particular domain. Because we don’t want 50 Silicon Valleys; we want 50 different variations of Silicon Valley, all unique from each other and all focusing on different domains. Imagine a Bitcoin Valley, for instance, where some country fully legalizes cryptocurrencies for all financial functions. Or a Drone Valley, where a particular region removes all legal barriers to flying unmanned aerial vehicles locally. A Driverless Car Valley in a city that allows experimentation with different autonomous car designs, redesigned roadways and safety laws. A Stem Cell Valley. And so on. There’s a key difference from the if-you-build-it-they-will-come argument of yore. Here, the focus is more on driving regulatory competition between city, state, and national governments. There are many new categories of innovation out there and entrepreneurs eager to go after opportunities within each of them. Rethinking the regulatory barriers in specific industries would better draw the startups, researchers and divisions of big companies that want to innovate in the vanguard of a particular domain — while also exploring and addressing many of the difficult regulatory issues along the way. Why this approach? Compared with previous innovation-cluster efforts where governments contrived to do something unnatural, this proposal flows from what governments naturally do best: create, or rather, relax laws. Another advantage of this approach is that it’s a way for clusters to differentiate from each other and successfully compete for resources. Think of it as a sort of “global arbitrage” around permissionless innovation — the freedom to create new technologies without having to ask the powers that be for their blessing. Entrepreneurs can take advantage of the difference between opportunities in different regions, where innovation in a particular domain of interest may be restricted in one region, allowed and encouraged in another, or completely legal in still another.For example, the laws and guidelines for using drones or taxing bitcoin already vary widely across the globe, just as they do for ride-sharing services across different cities in the U.S. But the biggest advantage of the 50-different-Silicon Valleys approach isn’t just in what it affords isolated regions or entrepreneurs — it’s in accelerating innovation everywhere. Removing regulations across different regions allows multiple innovation categories to advance together at once, in parallel, without being bottlenecked by time or place. So what are the risks? Well, there’s a real possibility that advanced regions will essentially outsource or “regulate away” their own risk at the expense of less advanced ones. To get ahead, poorer countries may become more tempted to take on the very things wealthier countries are fencing out of their borders. But as long as the innovations aren’t life-threatening — and many of the restricted domains aren’t (the restrictions are often protecting incumbent interests) — a model like this one provides a much faster and more feasible way for developing regions to catch up. Especially when you consider the advantage that previous innovation clusters didn’t have: mobile. With 5.9 billion smartphone users coming online in five years — largely due to the developing world — mobile acts not just as a leveler, but as a multiplier. As Tim Worstall argues: One way of thinking about economic growth…is that it’s all about the adoption of new technologies of production. We could say that the introduction of electricity was itself economic growth, or that the adoption of smartphones will be. However, they’re both multiplying technologies: electricity allows more work to be done by replacing muscle power and, through light, enables work or study to be done for more hours of the day. The smartphone opens up the books of human knowledge to those who have never had access to it before. And that is seriously going to accelerate economic growth in just about every other field as well. That peasant farmer trying to manage his acre of maize using nothing but a hoe and a machete: sure, he’s not going to be the world’s greatest user of Facebook…but he will benefit massively from information about weather, market prices, and better farming practices. Because of mobile, removing regulatory hurdles goes from being a potentially vicious cycle to a more virtuous one that can help millions of people climb out of poverty. And the next big companies wouldn’t be built in the U.S., but elsewhere in the world instead. For example, as mobile payment systems like M-Pesa create opportunities in banking, risk-sharing, and more, they’ve expanded to areas outside of Africa as well — including Europe. Meanwhile, allowing more experimentation in financial services could help those in countries that don’t have stable currencies (let alone banks) to more easily save and move their money across borders; some of these places would leapfrog, innovation-wise, through something like bitcoin. As for other domains, if we think of airspace as the next Internet-like platform, lifting restrictions on drones is one way to give other regions a chance to become the next significant locus of innovation. In fact, this kind of competition is probably the only way to create successful innovation clusters that can compete with the huge advantage Silicon Valley already has. In the United States, the “death of distance” due to improvements in communications technologies has historically benefited only ideas-producing places like New York, but not goods-producing ones like Detroit. That’s why turning Detroit into a commercial Drone Valley could draw the innovative people who in turn want to be near other innovative people around that domain. It’s already happening in places like Brazil, which are becoming known for being commercial drone-regulation friendly. It’s also happening in other domains, as genetic reporting companies like 23andme are forced to explore opportunities abroad, athletes go to places like Germany for biologic medicine, and even Japan considers slashing regulatory red tape to attract more drug R&D. But these examples are more reactive than proactive; I’m arguing for cities, states and countries to more systematically consider and create their regulatory competitive advantage. (If you don’t know what that advantage is, the best place to start is with local universities. Have a special competency in materials science? Then begin there.) This kind of regulatory arbitrage is already happening in the United States, too, through innovations like Google Fiber. Instead of the traditional model where telecoms competed to be in a particular city neighborhood, cities are the ones competing to get Google Fiber. And the ones most willing to relax their oft-arbitrary regulations and fees are the ones getting it. That’s another advantage of the regulatory arbitrage approach: It helps shake up regulatory capture altogether. The best defense of regulation is its use in protecting consumer interests, but the reality is that agencies and incumbents tend to watch out for their own entrenched interests and extract rents instead. There are cultural factors at play here, of course. After all, Silicon Valley isn’t just a place — it’s a state of mind. But instead of arguing about whether the Silicon Valley mindset cannot or should be copied, we need to shift our attention to an approach that addresses what Silicon Valley alone can’t do, while also creating opportunities for a broader set of people. To do that we need 50 different Silicon Valleys, not 50 failed clones. This piece first appeared in Politico. Editor: Sonal Chokshi @smc90"}
{"text":"Here are 10 ways to damage your fast-growing tech startup — and hurt the perception of Silicon Valley in the process. None of these are specific to any one company; they’re general patterns we’ve observed across multiple cycles of tech startups. #1 Only hiring — or training/motivating/incenting your managers to hire — without focusing on firing. Or on performance management and efficiency optimization. #2 Selling too much of your own personal stock too quickly, which alienates employees and leads people to question your long-term commitment as a founder. On a related note, letting private stock sales by employees get out of hand creates a “hit-and-run culture” — and forces your company to take on the burdens of being public before actually going public. #3 Diluting the crap out of the cap table by being sloppy and undisciplined with stock grants to early employees. This also plants hidden “morale landmines” for later employees. #4 Maximizing absolute valuation of each growth round, which not only makes later rounds harder and harder to achieve but can trigger a disastrous down round. #5 Letting investors (including, occasionally, private equity firms and hedge funds) suck you into terrible structural terms on growth rounds. You’re guaranteed massive trauma if anything goes even slightly wrong there. #6 Going public too soon! Going public before you’re a fortress, before you can withstand all assaults leads to a stock-price death spiral and ends up in a train wreck for everyone. #7 Pouring huge money into overly glorious new headquarters — “The Edifice Complex” — then repeating two years later. There’s also a danger in signaling to employees “we’ve made it, we’re amazing” (and while everyone hates the cramped but collaborative space when they’re in it, they miss it terribly after the move). #8 Assuming more cash is always available at higher and higher valuations, forever. This one will actually kill your company outright. #9 Confusing the conference circuit — and especially the party scene — with actual work. This also creates a toxic culture on multiple fronts by encouraging alcohol/drugs and valuing so-called “ballers” over other important, less “loud” contributors. #10 Refusing to take HR seriously! This issue isn’t specific to just tech-heavy environments; it’s prevalent in any highly creative, highly skilled workplace. At a certain company size, you need both the ability to manage people and an effective HR person. (Even though it is absolutely worth training company leadership in good HR practices, most managers are dangerously amateur at doing actual HR). Without smart, effective HR, terrible internal managerial and employee behavior leads to a toxic culture that can catalyze into a catastrophic ethical — and legal — crisis."}

{"text":"On behalf of the a16z team, I am excited to welcome Alex Rampell as our newest General Partner! Alex is perhaps best known as the CEO and co-founder of TrialPay, a leading transactional advertising and payments company serving digital goods and e-commerce clients such as Facebook, Zynga, and Gap, with 100+ employees and over $300M in cumulative revenue since inception. TrialPay was acquired in 2015 by Visa. TrialPay also spun out another company, Yub, the first offline affiliate network, where Alex simultaneously served as CEO through its acquisition in late 2013 by Coupons.com. Alex’s knowledge and experience of tech startups is comprehensive and encyclopedic. His interests and areas of expertise include software, security, crypto, payments, e-commerce, advertising, marketplaces, fintech, and more. He also coined the now internationally recognized term of O2O (“online to offline”) in 2010, and is a frequent commentator on the current and future state of monetization. Prior to TrialPay, Alex co-founded FraudEliminator, the first consumer anti-phishing company, which merged into our partner Chris Dixon’s company, SiteAdvisor, and was acquired by McAfee in 2006. And if that weren’t enough, Alex is also a cofounder of three other companies — TXN, a survey and transactional data company; Point, a real estate marketplace; and Affirm, with Max Levchin. We are investors in all three companies. Alex’s entrepreneurial nature surfaced early. His interests in software, entrepreneurship, and payments converged in 1991 at age 10, when he started writing and selling “shareware” programs on the then-nascent “Internet.” Within a week of uploading his first shareware program, he was receiving paper checks via postal mail — the only form of payment for digital goods at the time. Alex’s most successful shareware program was 1996’s AlwaysOnline, which re-dialed each AOL number 1,000 times and kept you on AOL forever. AlwaysOnline sold tens of thousands of copies (checks in the mail!), got banned by AOL (great press!), and paid for Alex’s college education. His entrepreneurial nature has burned brightly since. On top of his own entrepreneurial endeavors, Alex has actively invested in and advised dozens of startups, including Pinterest, Bloomreach, SiftScience, Wooga, Hunch, Truaxis, OrderAhead, Twice, and CardSpring. All of us at a16z are thrilled Alex is joining our team. His deep experience starting, running, and advising such a wide range of tech startups makes him ideally suited to coach and mentor the next generation of founders as a venture capitalist. His first day will be October 1, and we look forward to working together to help build the next generation of great technology companies!"}
{"text":"Today I am delighted to announce that Martin Casado is joining Andreessen Horowitz as a General Partner! Ben and I first met Martin in 2009 when he and colleagues from Stanford and UC Berkeley were forming their startup Nicira Networks. I vividly recall Martin, a newly minted Stanford Computer Science PhD, vigorously pitching us on a networking future where software would run the show. He was clearly speaking our language. a16z became Nicira’s first institutional investor, and Nicira launched into the networking industry like a cannonball hitting placid water. Very quickly the rest of the networking world followed the lead of Martin and the Nicira team toward what we now know as software defined networks (SDN). VMware subsequently bought Nicira for $1.26 billion in 2012, and startup history was made. But Martin wasn’t done yet. Whereas most founders with his deep technical background would either stay in the larger company in an architect role, or leave to found a new startup, Martin quickly became the general manager of VMware’s entire networking and security portfolio, managing thousands of the industry’s best and finest. This culminated with the product family, under Martin’s leadership, closing out 2015 at an astonishing $600 million annual revenue run rate, and with a six-fold increase in paying customers only three years after Nicira was acquired. Martin brings to a16z a very special set of skills. He’s worked on large-scale simulations of nuclear weapons at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Martin shifted his research focus to the intelligence community, determining the vulnerability to remote attack of networks through which flowed incredibly classified operations. You can imagine. While working in this environment, Martin realized that unlike computers, networking gear lacked the ability to be programmed and applied to use cases not intended by the vendors. One PhD later, Nicira was born. PhD-level technologist, industry visionary, product creator, company founder, business builder, and operating manager, Martin’s skill set is directly aligned with a16z’s core philosophy of working with the world’s best founders to help build the industry’s best companies. We are confident Martin will raise our game! Ben and I would like to especially thank our friends Andy Rachleff, Nick McKeown, Scott Shenker, and Steve Mullaney with whom Martin started and built Nicira — without them we would never have met Martin and this day wouldn’t be possible."}
{"text":"Today, we excitedly continue our investment in increasing inclusion and diversity in the technology sector. We will be providing a combined total of $275,000 in grants to four nonprofits: The COMMIT Foundation, VetsinTech, The Institute for Veterans and Military Families, and The Honor Foundation. These organizations tackle the issue of veteran inclusion from four unique perspectives and have developed innovative programs and interventions that target diverse populations within the veteran community. With 21.2 million military veterans in the U.S. — and another million who will transition out of the military in the next four years — the experiences, needs, and goals of the veteran community are wide-ranging and important. With varying educational attainment, distinct racial and ethnic backgrounds, increasing gender diversity (women are the fastest-growing segment of the veteran population), and unique needs for enlisted individuals and officers — the veteran community is diverse across myriad dimensions. While we have funded in an area we call “protecting the protectors” for many years — benefiting local police forces and highway patrol officers, CIA and FBI operatives and their families, as well as veterans — this gift marks a further commitment to enhance the future of this space and a desire to raise its profile nationally. Through extensive landscape analysis as well as discussions with researchers, experts, and numerous veterans, we have found the veteran community to be incredibly humble, entrepreneurial, and possessing deep leadership experience. Harnessing these skills would benefit numerous spaces beyond the military context. In tandem with these assets, we have found that the veteran community faces a series of challenges such as feelings of isolation, physical disabilities, mental health issues like post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, and a lack of resources and networks with which to channel their incredible life experiences and training into productive opportunities. Our overall impact goal is to help veterans, their families, and the companies they work for achieve their full potential. Investing in the long-term health of this space, we are providing funds specifically for organizational capacity building grants. These critical investment dollars help nonprofits build up their infrastructure and run more effectively and efficiently — which in turn leads to greater and more impactful service provision. We believe that our Veteran Inclusion Grants will address critical needs within this community, spur other funders to provide support, and ultimately help unlock even greater potential for some of our nation’s bravest individuals and deploy that intellectual capital, expertise and leadership in the technology sector. Marc and Laura Andreessen The COMMIT Foundation creates opportunities for veterans through corporate education programming and has been successful in working with Andreessen Horowitz in the past. We will fund a new position to work with their corporate partners, including their newest partner, Facebook, to improve veteran hiring, success and inclusion as well as share best practices around building a scalable model for corporate education, especially for tech companies. VetsinTech supports veterans through re-integration services that connect them to the national technology ecosystem. Our funding will allow them to increase their staff in order to scale programming and operational excellence. They utilize a data-driven approach by monitoring veteran success through pre-screening for technical aptitude, and tracking course progress as well as employment obtained upon program completion. The Institute for Veterans and Military Families (IVMF) — housed at Syracuse University — is the first interdisciplinary national institute in higher education providing research, analysis and community building focused on veterans and their families. We will provide IVMF with funding to launch an integrated alumni network across the seven programs that they run. IVMF is one of the longest-running and greatest impact-per-dollar organizations getting veterans into entrepreneurship and employment. They have robust programs, networks and systems. The Honor Foundation creates pathways for Special Forces veterans (e.g. Navy Seals) to transition from the military to private sector careers. We are providing support for building out their online learning technology, data warehousing, visualization and analytical capabilities, as well as funding assessments to measure the effectiveness of their interventions."}
{"text":"Editor’s note: This article is based on an episode of the a16z Podcast, which you can listen to here. Hi, and welcome to the a16z Podcast. I’m Hanne. In this episode, a16z co-founder Marc Andreessen, and general partner on the Bio Fund Jorge Conde, take a look back at Marc’s “Software will eat the world” thesis, and think about where we are now, nearly a decade later: how software has delivered on that promise, and where it is yet to come. In the wide-ranging conversation, the two partners discuss everything from the learnings of software’s transformation of the music and automotive industries, to how software will now eat healthcare—including what exactly changed in the fields of bio and computer science to make Marc eat his own words. This conversation was originally recorded as part of an event at a16z. Jorge: I’m so thrilled to have our founder, our co-founder and general partner, Marc Andreessen here. For those of you that are traveling home after this via an airport, you will probably see this smiling face on the cover of a magazine. Marc: Magazines. I’m told that this is a new technological device and its content comes pre-printed on the paper. Apparently, it’s got excellent battery life. Marc: But it doesn’t update very fast. Jorge: You can’t swipe, but you could rip it. So you have to be very careful. Marc: You can try swiping. Jorge: So, what we thought we’d do here is spend some time talking about how technology can transform industries. And I think there’s no better person, really anywhere, to talk a bit about how technology does transform the world we live in. So, I thought we’d start from the very, very beginning. Part of the reason why you’re on the cover of a paper computer right now is because the firm is about 10 years old. And, you know, around the launch of the firm, you articulated your vision of what was happening in the world, that software is eating the world. I’ve seen you on stage with Clay Christensen, who is a Harvard Business School professor who coined the term “disruptive innovation.” One of the things he spends a lot of his time on is describing what disruptive innovation is and what it is not. Jorge: So, I thought maybe one place to start is to have you describe what, in your mind, software eating the world means, and what it doesn’t mean. Marc: Sure. Yeah, so the term is from an essay that I wrote that The Wall Street Journal ran in, I think, 2011. So, shortly after we started the firm. And so the basic observation was that the tech industry, the sort of modern tech industry as we understand it in Silicon Valley, the one you’re sitting in the middle of right now, is about a 70 year-old industry. It started right after World War II, when there were like a total of like five computers on the planet. And then over the course of the next 70 years, it figured out a way to pack leading-edge, state-of-the-art, supercomputer technology that used to cost $25 million and $50 million into a $500 product that we all now have. There’s like four billion smartphones on the planet now, on the way to seven billion. So there’s a 70-year journey to basically get everybody on a computer, and everybody on the internet, that worked. And it was a long journey and lots of drama, lots of hits and starts. But it did fundamentally work. So that’s like, okay, is the industry finished? Like, are we done? Congratulations, everybody has a computer, everybody’s on the internet, mission accomplished. What’s next? And especially back then, this was after the financial crisis, there was a prevailing mood of pessimism about the global economy, and the American economy, and the technology industry. Lots of press coverage at the time was like, you know, tech’s just in another stupid bubble, and there’s nothing interesting happening. There’s nothing left to do. Innovation is dead. From here on out, it’s all just stupid, little silly games and things that don’t matter. And so my view is sort of the exact opposite. Which is not only that we’re not done, we’re just beginning. Now that we have a computer in everybody’s pocket, an incredibly powerful computer with a lot of capabilities—which we’ll talk about—related to health. And then, everybody’s on the internet. Everybody is connected to everybody else, and to an entire universe of services, and information, and communications, and everything else. To me, it’s just like, that’s the beginning, right? It took 70 years to build the platform, get into position. What can we do on top of that? And so what I tried to do with the concept of “software is eating the world” is say, “Okay, how does this unfold from here, across industries?” And the way I described it was in three layers, and sort of three claims, which I would say, increase as you go in audacity or arrogance, depending on your point of view, or just flat out hubris, which is another possibility. So the first claim is that any product or service in any field that can become a software product, will become a software product. And so if you’re used to doing something on the phone, that will go to software. If you’re used to doing something on paper, that will go to software. If you’re used to doing something in person, that can go to software — it will go to software. If you’ve had a physical product, and think about things like, telephone answering machines, or tape players, boom boxes, like, all the things Radio Shack used to sell. They’re all apps on the phone, right? Cameras? Yeah, I remember there used to be a physical product called the camera. And, you know, that got vaporized. By the way, the physical newspaper, physical magazines. If it can become bytes, it becomes bytes. Why does it become bytes? Well, if it’s bytes, it’s better in a lot of ways. Bytes are zero marginal cost, so they’re easy to replicate at scale, and become much more cost effective. Anything that can get into software, will get into software. A lot of bytes is disruptive-free. By the way, they’re much more environmentally-friendly, which is an increasing thing for a lot of people. You know, you can change bytes much more quickly. You can innovate much more quickly, add new features, add new capabilities. So there’s just lots and lots of reasons why it’s good to get things from physical form into software, if you can. And so anything that can get into software, will get into software. The next claim is that every company in the world that is in any of these markets in which this process is happening, has to become a software company, right? So companies that historically either did not have a technology component to what they did, or maybe have the classic conception of technology and business, which is called IT, right. We got these gnomes in the back office, and they’ve got their lab coats, and they’ve got their mainframes, and they do their thing. And they print out these reports, and for some reason, the reports are still in all caps. You know, like, there’s that. But then there’s modern software development. And especially customer experiences — what’s the actual interface to the customer? And any company deals with customers, especially consumers, is going to have to really radically up its game, in terms of its ability to build the kinds of UIs and experiences that people expect these days. So every company becomes a software company. And then the most audacious claim is, as a consequence of one and two, in the long run, in every market, the best software company will win. And that doesn’t necessarily mean that a new company which starts as a software company entering an existing market will win, but it also doesn’t necessarily mean that an incumbent that adapts to being a software company will win. The most audacious claim is, as a consequence of one and two, in the long run, in every market, the best software company will win. And that doesn’t necessarily mean that a new company which starts as a software company entering an existing market will win, but it also doesn’t necessarily mean that an incumbent that adapts to being a software company will win. In fact, you see this increasingly in many industries, including healthcare and insurance. You’ll see many cases now where you’ll have these new pure play software companies entering these incumbent markets. And maybe they’re coming from a position of youth naivety, and maybe they’re wrong and maybe their idea is stupid, or maybe it’s Uber or Lyft entering the taxi market, and maybe they just have a fundamentally better software-driven approach. And then you’ve got incumbents scrambling to try to basically figure out how to become software companies. Which is tricky, because software—the way we think about it—is different. It’s not the same. It’s different. It’s a different product to develop than a lot of people are used to. The culture of a software company is different than the culture of most existing companies. And then the kinds of people you need to hire to build software, especially modern software, mobile software, AI software, cloud software—these are special people. And I say ‘special,’ you know, multiple definitions of special. These are highly creative individuals. Just a random example: the defense contractors and intelligence agencies are having to revamp all their drug use policies right now. The whole pee-in-a-cup thing before you get hired doesn’t work if you’re trying to hire modern software development. That’s just, like, one random example. But there are lots of instances where these cultures are different. And then you can say, okay, if that’s the framework, then you can go industry-by-industry and say, which industries are more prone for that to happen in? Obviously, in some industries, it’s super clear. The media industry is an example where it’s just obvious how fast that’s happening. There are other industries, like cars, which is an example we might talk about quite a bit. Transportation is right in the middle—the incumbents in the auto industry have a really good claim on the idea that building cars is incredibly hard, incredibly dangerous, fairly regulated. And the idea that a bunch of software founders out in the valley are going to start car companies is absurd. But there’s, you know, 500 self-driving car startups within 50 miles of where we sit. What those founders would tell you is all the value, 90% of the value of the car, in 5 or 10 years is going to be in software, because the car is going to be an autonomous electric vehicle, right? Since it’s going to be autonomous, it’s going to be self-driving, which means it’s going to have all the software that the legacy car companies don’t know how to make, and then it’s going to be electric, so it’s not going to have all the internal combustion components that these car companies have spent 100 years optimizing. And then, by the way, the car might go from being a consumer product that people buy, to just being a service that people access on demand, right? And so ride-sharing networks in the self-driving world might just be you don’t own a car—you just press a button, and a self-driving car shows up and takes you where you need to go. And so, I would say there’s a pitch battle shaping up in the auto industry. And then there’s a bunch of other industries in which I would say the incumbents are, you know, much more comfortable. They don’t face a disruptive challenge. Maybe they’re right, maybe they’re not. Education is becoming a very hot market. Education is not a market that you would characterize as having had a lot of innovation over the last 1,000 years. There’s now a new generation of founders out here that have some pretty compelling new offers in education. I would say even real estate, there’s a surprising amount of innovation happening. Actually law is a field which is not traditionally super innovative. There’s a lot of new software entrance into the political field. And so, people are going to be trying in every industry. Jorge: Yeah. I want to make sure we get to the healthcare-shaped elephant in the room at some point. But to look back on the software eats the world thesis, the three audacious claims, as you called them—any surprises that you’ve seen in the intervening years that you’ve said, “Okay, you know, if I were to rewrite that today, I would have taken a different view”? Marc: I think the big one, as I mentioned already, is what’s happening in the car industry. When we started the firm 10 years ago, I never imagined that we’d be investing in literally new car companies. The auto industry was like an entrepreneurial industry in, like, 1890, right? And then in the 1920s Henry Ford, the guy who was the Bill Gates of his era, figured the whole thing out. And then there were no new American car companies. There was one major new American car company since the 1920s, but there were hundreds of new car companies in the 1910s, and they shrunk to basically three, and then they stabilized. There was an entrepreneur named Preston Tucker in the 1950s who created a car company called Tucker Automotive, as the bold new thing. It was such a catastrophe—they made a movie about what a catastrophe it was, called Tucker. If you were an entrepreneur tempted to start a car company, just watch the movie Tucker, and it’s like, “Okay, I’m not doing that.” The idea that an industry that established would be opening up the way that it is, is very striking. It’s been the most striking one. By the way, I use the term ‘software’ very broadly in the sense of code that runs on shapes and networks. You’ve all, I’m sure, been reading about and seeing the rise of these concepts called ‘machine learning,’ ‘deep learning,’ ‘artificial intelligence.’ In the valley, there are two profound and logical revolutions happening right now that have the best engineers the most excited, and that’s one of them. By the way, the other one is cryptocurrency-blockchain, which is a whole other conversation. But machine learning, deep learning, AI, is an incredibly fertile area of creativity right now, and is advancing at an incredibly high rate of speed, technologically. The other question that I think is increasingly coming up when we think about the kinds of companies and founders we back is how AI native or machine learning native the founders are, as well as their companies. Even in the valley, there’s a big spread, I think, between the software founders that have really figured out this new technology and how to use it, and the founders that still haven’t tuned up on it. So it’s like very much in flux. If that stuff works the way that it looks like it might work, that could really be transformative, even beyond just the idea of software. Jorge: I think that’s right. If we look at a couple of the industries that have been responsive and receptive, and the auto industry, I think it’s a big surprise, that they would have adapted to the fact that cars are becoming more software-centric. What about industries that have been almost entirely transformed? So take, for example, the music industry. I think if you live outside of Silicon Valley, if you sort of looked at the first wave of the internet, one of the first industries that was fundamentally transformed was the music industry. Jorge: Do you think that other industries will likely suffer that fate that music has? Marc: Yeah, so it’s a funny thing. Music, I think, is something like a triple whammy. First of all, one of the interesting things about music was that people really love music. And I say that because generally, when we fund startups, the question always is, “Will the dogs eat the dog food” Are people actually going to want this thing? So what was the huge issue with music? It was piracy. All of a sudden, the music listeners went crazy and started breaking the law and started to listen to music online. The record labels all freaked out, and they were like, our customers have turned evil. Well, maybe. But, isn’t it great that they all love music so much? And for some reason, the music executives who I knew never thought that was a very good point. But I thought it was. I was like, look, they want the thing. Normally in business, when the customers are lined up out the door and they’re like, “I want to consume music digitally,” you would normally want to say, “Okay, I want to find a way to service them.” The music label heads went, “No, you shouldn’t be able to get music digitally.” And so that was the first interesting thing. It was the reverse of the normal supply and demand problem you have. It was, literally, overwhelming consumer demand for online music, streaming music, digital music. It was overwhelming with suppliers refusing to accommodate it. So that was weird. So why is that happening? Well, then you get into the pricing, right? There’s 12 songs on the album, album costs $17 bucks, and I want one of the songs, right? And congratulations, I can just pay $17 for a song and then another 11 songs I don’t want. Okay, well, that’s weird. The whole structure of the record industry was built up around that. And then there was the thing that it actually got down to, which took a while to surface, but it ultimately did finally come out, which was it was a cartel. It was like a full on anti-competitive monopolistic cartel of price fixing. We now know that because there were antitrust cases from this era that finally appealed the whole thing, so this has all become public record. But they were all colluding. There were four or five labels, and they were all getting together and setting prices. And that’s, in retrospect, why they were so dug in. It was a magical business model, right? Let’s imagine you could collude, and then let’s imagine as a consequence of that, you could overcharge by a factor of 10. Like, wouldn’t that be great? And so that, in retrospect, was the thing that I think a lot of us out here missed, because their behavior was just so illogical. The problem was that lasted until it didn’t last, right? The consumers were breaking the law. They were doing the wrong thing, but for the right reasons. They had concluded that the industry that was servicing them was actually immoral, which was correct. It actually was immoral. It is immoral to price fix and collude, and illegal. You had illegal customer behavior and illegal supplier behavior. What a super healthy market. So what’s the moral of the story? Well, that which can become software will become software. There was just overwhelming demand. We all live this today. How do I want to listen to music? I pull up Spotify on my phone and listen to music. The idea of being forced to figure out which box in the garage has the CDs, you know, it just sounds like medieval torture. And so the thing that can become software will become software. Prices are going to rationalize, and we could talk more about that. But there’s a big, I think, rationalization of prices happening across economy that’s pretty interesting, as a consequence of the increased transparency. The suppliers, like, you know, the cartels attached to the old technology aren’t going to survive. That kind of transformation is going to be a really big deal. And it took time. It took 15 years. 15 years of the record labels trying to hold out. By the way, it was 15 years of tech startups to try to solve this problem. You probably remember if you’re into music, there was Napster, which got put out of business early on. But then there was Kazaa, and there was LimeWire, and there was BitTorrent. And then there were all the early streaming services. Actually, it’s interesting as they were all terrible venture investments. They were all catastrophes, right? Because they were too early. Because they couldn’t get the rights to the music, because the labels, they wouldn’t do the deal, so they could never get the rights to the music, and so they can never actually offer a service that consumers actually wanted that was also legal. And so they were actually all bad investments. But then finally, after 15 years, the pressure built to the point where it actually was time for a fundamental change. And that’s when Spotify catalyzed. Actually, a lot of VCs, like us, did not invest in Spotify at that time because there was this 15-year history that all the other attempts to do what Spotify was doing had failed. But the time had actually come, right? And that was obvious. Music is like $10 a month, and you listen to it. Spotify has, I don’t know how many, but Spotify is going to end up with like a billion subs. They’re like $10 bucks a month, and then they’re parceling out all the money to the artists. Jorge: Everything that in music could become software, has become software. The one thing that still you have to do in person is the experiential part of going to see a musician perform. So, that’s where musicians today make a lot of their money, right? In terms of going and having the in-person piece. And I think, if you look at the healthcare industry, I think there’s probably some element to that. There is always going to be human element, an in-person component to treating and managing disease and patients. Marc: Actually, there’s a related point there. Clay Christensen actually points this out. There’s this weird thing where when one industry layer commoditizes, the next layer can become incredibly valuable. And this is deceptive thing, because people are focused on the layer that’s commoditizing and the shrinkage of the market cap. They tend to think that the whole industry is going down. There’s this weird thing where when one industry layer commoditizes, the next layer can become incredibly valuable. But look, the music industry contracted, right? The amount of money people spent on recorded music shrunk dramatically. It’s finally starting to grow again with streaming, but it shrunk dramatically over the course of, you know, 15-20 years. What actually happened that’s super interesting is the compliment expanded dramatically. So over that same time period, I think the U.S. market for live concerts over the last 15 years grew 4X. And it makes sense, which is like, “Okay, congratulations Mr. Consumer. Congratulations, you now have unlimited access to all the recorded music you want. It’s now free. Everybody has it.” There’s no status. You don’t have record labels. You don’t have LPs lined up in your shelf. And if you’re courting a young man or a young woman, and they come over and you want to show off your music, you go, “Hey, look at my Spotify,” it’s not the same. There’s no social effect to it. It’s not really fun. It’s like consumer Nirvana, except it’s like they drained all of the fun. What’s fun is going to the concert. And, by the way, I’m not spending as much money recording music, and therefore, I have more money available to actually buy concert tickets. And so the concert business, the experience side of it, has exploded in revenue. You could easily hypothesize the exact same thing happening in healthcare, right? Marc: For example, if more of the actual products and services in healthcare could get commoditized, and over time you could break the cost curves and actually shrink it, maybe concierge medicine would just explode, right? Maybe a lot more people will actually want the concierge experience today. They just can’t afford it. But if you crack the price curve and a lot of the other stuff, maybe you could open that up. So basically, the moral of that is just pay attention to complements. It’s never a single factor. There are other implications for other areas of spending. Basically, the moral of that is just pay attention to complements. It’s never a single factor. There are other implications for other areas of spending. Jorge: Actually, on that note, given the healthcare industry, we are in one way shape or form all customers of the healthcare industry. Over our lifetime, we will be. You served on the board of the Stanford Hospital for five, six years. Could you talk a little bit about what you learned about the delivery of healthcare, from serving on the board of a hospital, and really coming in as a lay person to the industry? Marc: I would say the best thing about it was, you know, the mission of the place was obviously just amazing. And I say that the mission, both in terms of the actual healthcare, but also the mission of the translation of medical research, you know, the integration with the medical school and all the research happening. It was a nonprofit with highly motivated people, which was exciting to see. There was innovation happening all over the place. And in fact, it was actually exciting because we had the chance to actually design and build a new hospital, which I’m delighted to say is opening, finally, this fall. So we green-lit the project, I believe in 2005. We’re opening it in 2019. Jorge: These are all 15 years cycles that you’re describing. Marc: We spend a lot of time on the design of the new hospital, which was super interesting. You know, the two things that were probably the biggest surprises, the thing that just really jumped out, is one, there are 25 board members, right? So our boards, our well-functioning boards to our companies, are like, seven people. Beyond seven people, you can’t have a good discussion. And so, 25 people, it’s like a UN summit. I would not describe the board meetings as highly dynamic. We didn’t really get into a lot of the issues. The other thing that blew me away, which I’m still tracking and fascinated by, was the issue of quality. I happened to join the board right after we hired our first chief quality officer, which was a guy who had come out of management consulting, Six Sigma, a manufacturing, quality thing. For those of you who know the history of these things, the U.S. auto industry was a huge assembly industry in the 50s and 60s, but it had this massive quality problem, which was like, literally, people were dying. There were no seatbelts in the cars. The steering columns were impaling people. There were all kinds of horrific problems. Then when the Japanese and the Germans came in with safer cars, it catalyzed a huge crisis in the U.S. auto industry, and Ralph Nader made his name, originally, by crusading. The book was called Unsafe At Any Speed, which was a reference both to the car and to the industry. And then starting in the 70s, 80s, 90s, the auto industry implemented this thing, TQM, Total Quality Management, Six Sigma, which was a process to get all the bugs out, the idea of defect-free manufacturing. If you buy a car today, it’s a far higher quality experience than a car 50 years ago. And usually, it’s actually a much better experience than a car 10 or 20 years ago. They’re quite good now. You read these histories when they figured out cholera in the water, what germs are, what an infection is. It was 1880 or something when they figured out it’s a good idea to wash your hands before you perform surgery. And so it’s 2004, and there are still doctors walking into rooms and getting people sick. The compliance rates for the scrubbing of the rooms, it’s like, I don’t know, 34% or something. I was just like, “Oh, fuck,” like…sorry. It’s like, how can you… Anyway, so that was at the front end of that. It’s been fascinating to track that, because on the one hand it’s very clear that they’ve made a lot of progress. On the other hand, there is innovation yet to be done. I’m sure you guys know all this, but the data on medication compliance is absolutely horrifying, right? It’s like a third of all prescribed medications are unfilled, right? Another third or not, people don’t take them on schedule, right? Older people, you give them like 8, 10, or 12 different medications, and they’re supposed to track it. They’ll just dump all their medications into the candy bowl, and mix it all up, and every day, they’ll take a handful of pills, right? And actually, that’s pretty good, right? That’s better than it’s all on a shelf somewhere and they can’t get the bottles open. And so, medication compliance is a train wreck. It’s actually, I read this thing the other day. Medication compliance on the medication after organ transplants is actually, terrible. It’s only, for kidney transplants, like 60% compliance. Jorge: It’s incredible. Marc: It’s incredible, right? And the other 40%, like, you’re going to die, right? And they still can’t get compliance. And there’s very different reasons for that. And so there’s that issue. Another is literally tracking the doctors. Like, just an idea that we should fund. Actually, we’re seeing all these new technologies that do things, like for example, watch an assembly line environment, to have cameras that watch everybody’s time in motion, like in the factory. You can use these machine learning technologies to decode if people doing the right thing. Are they tightening the screws, tightening the bolts? Are the machines running properly? Maybe we should have a camera outside every patient door, and, like, are the doctors and nurses actually scrubbing their hands? Marc: Yeah, Purell. Like, doing Purell tracking. I think the reality is that there’s a lot of basic stuff that’s still not being done. And the problem with this kind of thing is that the medical errors are the most common in the hospital. I think the reality is that there’s a lot of basic stuff that’s still not being done. Marc: I think they’re the third. And then this whole issue of infection, you know, hospital-borne infections. I think it’s an open question: how much of that is fixable errors and not compliance issues? Jorge: And it’s still not getting better. Marc: Yeah, right. Exactly. Jorge: While you were on the board of the hospital, when folks think about software in healthcare, EMR is the example that a lot of people gravitate towards. Did you go through the experience of incorporating and implementing an EMR at Stanford, while you were on the board? Jorge: Tell us a little bit about that process. Marc: Oh, yeah. We put that out to bid. I think we got back one viable bid, I think, for the complexity at Stanford hospital. It was Epic. It was a $400 million project. And then of the 300, we went out for integration bids. And this is where I almost started crying. It was Perot systems. Jorge: Ross Perot systems? Marc: Ross Perot systems. Perot systems was the follow up to EDS. Ross Perot’s company, which is now owned by Dell. And so, yes, it’s a $400 million project Perot systems. This was 2005, I think, when we started the Epic implementation. They were very excited. They were very excited in the demo. I was very excited, because I was like, “Wow, this is like a new hospital, and it’s probably going to be mobile and there’s going to be sensors and like all this stuff. It’s going to be great.” They were super excited because they had just moved to Windows 95 UI, right? In 2005. It was like the big upgrade from Windows 3.1. And I was like, “Oh, my God.” But, as you know, it’s 2019 and it’s still the same thing. Marc: The other incredibly entertaining thing about Epic is that they are so, you know, out here. There’s a big focus on software interoperability. And so it’s like can one piece of software work with another? You know, is this whole concept of work. There are entire companies now that are called API companies that build, basically, software building blocks that you plug together. There’s open-source. And so out here it’s just this constant process of everybody building on everybody else’s creativity, and the whole thing rises. Except for Epic—which has an absolute prohibition on third party integration. It does not tolerate it. Will sue you if you attempt to integrate with it. Jorge: So, in the early days of the firm, you famously said that you won’t see a16z investing in bio and in healthcare. And that’s obviously changed. Can you talk a little bit about the evolution of that thought process? Marc: Modern venture capital is like, roughly 50 years old. It started in the 1970s in the modern form. There are, basically, two fields within venture that actually worked. There are sort of what you might call, you know, digital technologies, computer-based technologies, IT, broadly defined. And then there’s biotech. And biotech kind of broke down, traditionally, into new therapies, and new treatments, and new medical devices. And actually, a lot of the best venture capital firms actually had dual practices, right? So there are many examples, Kleiner Perkins being a very prominent one for a long time. They’re dual practices, and so they have what they call the digital team, then they have the healthcare team. Once upon a time, they collaborated, they all worked together. And then what happened is that the economics of those two sectors just fundamentally diverged. The fundamental reason for this is in the digital technologies and digital venture. You’re fundamentally writing this code called Moore’s Law, right? Basically, the pricing of the underlying components for software and hardware, falls in half every 18 months. So you got this amazing downward cost curve, and that’s why you keep coming up with new applications for computers, because everything keeps getting cheaper, and really quickly. In pharma, in new pharma and in new medical devices, you have the reverse of Moore’s Law, literally, which is called Erooms’ Law, E-R-O-O-M, which is Moore backwards. And Eroom’s Law is the cost to bring a new drug or a new medical device to market, doubles every n years. So the cost goes the wrong direction, right? Upwards. And basically 20 years ago, 15 years ago, what happened was the VCs that were in both decided that that didn’t work anymore. The economic cycles were too different. You could fund Facebook with $20 million and go to the moon, or you could fund a new pharma effort with a billion dollars, and still probably have to raise another three billion by the time you’re done. Or end up selling out to big pharma at some point. They just became two fundamentally different domains. By the way, they were two fundamentally different sciences, right, because they’re sort of computer science on the one side, and biological science on the other side. They didn’t really intersect. You don’t really use computers that much doing your drug discovery and your medical devices. The situation we saw in 2009 was they were actually separating out. The leading biotech VCs now are not names that anybody in Silicon Valley would even necessarily know because it’s such a different world. What we started to see about six years ago around 2012, probably 2013, is a new kind of founder show up. We started seeing founders showing up with PhDs in biology, often MDs, and then also either degrees in computer science, or the equivalent of degrees in computer science. Sometimes with dual PhDs, but also sometimes they were like, “I’m a PhD in bio, but I’ve actually been programming computers since I was 10.” I’ve got 20 years or whatever, sort of the equivalent of educational experience in computer science. These founders are showing up with these kind of hybrid technologies that were half bio, half computer science. And then honestly, they would come in and pitch us, right? This is what I always called “The dogs watching TV”. They’d be up there and they’d be talking about the genome and this and that, and you’re like, “Whoa, I’ve heard these words before, I don’t quite know what they mean.” And then they would mention algorithm, and we’d all go, “Woof!” Like, you know, we get that. But we didn’t know quite what to make of these. We’d ask the founders this. We’d be like, “Well, what happened?” You go pitch the bio VCs, the healthcare VCs, like, what are they doing? It’s like, “You know, it’s so weird. It’s like dogs watching TV, except we go on and on and on about machine learning, and they just look at us puzzled. And then we’d say, you know, ribonucleic, and they get all excited.” Actually, it’s interesting. It’s the convergence of the scientific domains. It’s the conversion of the technological domains. And then that means the convergence of the industries. We just started to see this repeating pattern of these new kinds of founders. We said these bio VCs have gotten so detached from computer science that they’re unlikely to figure this out. A bunch of computer science VCs just shut down their healthcare practices, they’re not probably going to leap back into it. Maybe there’s this new thing in the middle. It’s the convergence of the scientific domains. It’s the conversion of the technological domains. And then that means the convergence of the industries. We just started to see this repeating pattern of these new kinds of founders. And then we got our partner, Vijay, who was a professor at Stanford, where he was literally right in the middle of this convergence in his time at Stanford. And he came over and he spun us up on this whole domain. And then [you] Jorge joined us, subsequently. I think we’ve discovered there’s a real vein here, right? It’s interesting, because we are seeing more of the CS-focused VCs starting to edge in now and adapt. We’re also seeing more of the life sciences VCs starting to edge in, but still, there’s this thing in the middle. There’s for sure the pure convergence, which was like the concept of digital therapeutics, for example diabetes, and so forth. And then there’s all these potentially new kinds of diagnostic and sensors; there’s the use of sensors in the phone to do diagnostics, things like that. There’s a lot of work happening in bioinformatics, and the research side. Cloud biology is a big thing that we have. And then there’s applying information technology to the operations of the actual healthcare industry, which gets into things like medical records, hospital management services, and stuff like that. We basically decided we’re taking a very broad brush at this, and we’re working in all those areas. And I think we’re finding it to be a very dynamic and very fertile area. Jorge: Absolutely. What advice would you give to industry leaders in terms of how to engage with innovators with entrepreneurs? And conversely, what advice should we be giving to entrepreneurs to engage with folks that are leading the industry? Marc: The big difference between how the Valley works and the rest of the business world works is as follows. In most of the business world, you’ve got some existing position and you’re trying to figure out what to do with it, and you’re trying to figure out how to defend it, you know, like defend a market. You’re trying to figure out how to advance and innovate within the market, but you’re dealing with big existing companies, big existing businesses. Out here, we don’t generally have that. We’re generally starting from scratch. I think the way to think about it is that Silicon Valley startups are experiments, first and foremost. They’re experiments often in technology. We try to take a lot of scientific experimental risk, but they’re technological experiments. Can we build the product? And they are also business experiments, which is like, you know, is anybody going to want this thing? Am I going to be able to make a business on it? Am I even going to be able to turn a profit on it? They’re experiments. You might say, well, that’s dumb. Why would you risk all this money and effort launching experiment for a product that you don’t know you can build, or anybody would want? Most of the world doesn’t run those experiments, and so maybe there should be one place that does, right? And this is that place. The ethos of the valley is that these are experiments. That’s actually what leads to this interesting phenomena in the valley, which is you’ll have founders that have a company that, in some cases, are like a famous train wreck. It just didn’t work at all. And then five years later, they’ll go start the next company, and they’ll easily raise money for it, right? Again, the rest of the world will be like, “Well, why are you getting behind somebody who already failed?” and the valley is like, “Well, if they learned along the way, and they’re now better at running the experiments the second time, let’s fund them to run the second experiment.” In fact, a lot of the best companies in the valley are founded by people who have one or two significant failures before they founded the winner. And so I view it like it’s an incredibly fertile landscape of experiments. There’s thousands of experiments being run. These are pretty big like, can we build the self-driving cars? Like, a pretty big experiment. When people, especially from established industries, come here, there’s a temptation to evaluate each experiment, one by one. You look at a given startup, and it’s like, “Well, I don’t know. This thing might work, the technology might work, the business might work. There’s all this idiosyncratic risk with this experiment. And I feel like I should make the decision whether or not to talk to the startup or work with the startup based on the characteristic of this particular instance.” That’s one way to do it. The other way to do it is more like what we do, which is you can say, “Well, look, it never makes sense to just run one experiment, but it might make sense to run 10 experiments.” It might be that the partnership model that makes sense is, let’s put together a portfolio. Let’s figure out 10 areas that we think are potentially interesting. Let’s find the 10 most interesting startups in those areas, and then let’s try 10 partnerships. Let’s think about it very explicitly as a portfolio of investments, a portfolio of partnerships, a portfolio of new supplier relationships, whatever it is. And then let’s evaluate the result of those 10 experiments as a basket, right? The nature of probabilities being what it is, some of them are going to work, some of them are not, right? But the ones that are going to work might work really, really well, right? What I just described to you is literally what we do. It’s the venture capital mentality. But it’s also, I think, the best construct for thinking through how to engage with startups as a big company. By the way, the other side of it is that there’s a temptation to measure if a new joint venture or a new investment will succeed or not. The traditional way you report this to the board is like, you know, green light, yellow light, red light, like this famous management consulting chart with the bulbs. You want all the lights to be green—if any lights are yellow, people will have very stern looks. And if any lights are red, like, it’s a disaster, and somebody gets fired. And so, you know, it’s pass/fail, right? It’s not a question of like, does it work? It’s a question of, if it works, how big can it get? If it works, how big of an impact could it have? I actually think that the way that you want to think about this is, you know, it’s not a question of like, does it work? It’s a question of, if it works, how big can it get? If it works, how big of an impact could it have? So a new technology you might be looking at in your business that might be a new route to market, or a new way to cut costs, if it cut costs, good. Does it cut a million dollars’ worth of cost, or a billion dollars’ worth of cost? That might be the actual relevant question, as opposed to just success/failure. The nature of these things is, these experiments often don’t work, but when they do work, they can actually work really, really well. They can get really, really big and have a really, really big impact. And so yeah, so that’s the general model. It’s a portfolio approach, and then an understanding and appreciation of asymmetric nature of the winds relative to the odds that there will be some set of losses. Jorge: Okay. Great. Silicon Valley has been pretty visible in movies and television, etc. You may have had a hand in some of that yourself, in terms of advising some of the shows. Marc: No comment. Only the good ones. Jorge: What do you wish that people that didn’t live here in Silicon Valley knew about Silicon Valley? Marc: It’s funny, I’ve been listening to the Elon Musk audio book. You just made me remember, before the Model S shipped, everybody thought he was just completely full of it, right? And like, he was going to make this car and there was just no way, it’s impossible, it can’t be done. And then this freaking car comes out, right? The Model S comes out, and it literally wins car-of-the-year awards everywhere. It has the best safety rating of any car ever made. There were all these people who were like, “Oh, yeah, he’s a fraud.” They were, literally, mouth hanging open, like, I cannot believe it, right? And so that is the more common story. The scientific and technical substance of what happens out here does tend to be quite real. But then the other side of it are experiments. If this stuff was a slam dunk, or sorry, if it’s obvious how to apply a scientific result into a technological product and then build a business around it, big companies are going to do all that.There are lots and lots of big companies in the world in healthcare, outside of healthcare, in the tech industry, that are good at doing the obvious stuff. By the nature of the Valley, we’re doing the non-obvious stuff. We’re doing the stuff that’s not yet proven. We’re doing the stuff that’s controversial. We’re doing the stuff that really might fail. There is a risk with each and everything that we do, whether or not it will work. But God willing, when it does work, it could get really big. By the nature of the Valley, we’re doing the non-obvious stuff. We’re doing the stuff that’s not yet proven. We’re doing the stuff that’s controversial. We’re doing the stuff that really might fail. There is a risk with each and everything that we do, whether or not it will work. But God willing, when it does work, it could get really big. Jorge: Wonderful. Thank you. So let me see if there are any questions in the audience that we could field? Question: So we’re here today in a place that’s known as a center of innovation. But many of us have to go be agents for innovation and change in industries that aren’t necessarily as open to it. What is your advice for that—how do you think about doing something innovative, that you believe in, that you think will work, when others might say oh, we’re more traditional, this is the way things are done? Marc: So there’s actually a term of art in the industry, in the valley, for it. It’s called “The Evangelist Sale.” It’s actually really interesting. It’s like our companies come to market with a new product, a new widget that does something, and they’ll go hire sales reps out of companies that sell normal products, and those sales reps will come in and they’ll take the product, and they’ll just completely whiff, because they’ll get back this reaction from every customer being like, “Yeah, I’m used to buying whatever, Oracle databases from you, but I don’t know what to do with this new thing.” And then those sales reps actually don’t know how to sell that thing, and those marketing people don’t know how to market that thing. It’s a different kind of thing. And so there’s a specific kind of seller sales rep and marketing person out here, sort of the evangelistic seller, or the evangelistic marketer. Honestly, I don’t know, there’s magic, and it has to do with painting a vision, right? It has to do with painting a vision of the future. That’s the marketing. It’s sort of what Steve Jobs used to say, the problem with consumer research is nobody knew they wanted a Macintosh, right? Nobody knew they wanted an iPhone, like, until the thing showed up. People can’t visualize new products on their own. And so you have to paint a picture and that picture has to be vivid, right? This is where some of these guys like Elon get criticized for overselling. But they have to paint a vivid picture. For example, Elon comes out with the Model S, right? Congratulations, this is a car that you plug into specialized charging ports. Well, how many specialized charging ports out there that I can plug this car into? Zero. Okay, I’m going to buy a model. It’s like buying the first fax machine. It’s like, congratulations, I now have the first fax machine, who can I fax? You know, I now have a very expensive doorstop, good job. And so what Elon did when he launched the Model S is he painted a picture; he went up, give a big presentation and said, “Look, we’re going to put these supercharger stations in all these different locations along all these freeways.” He mapped the whole thing out, and he’s like, “Here, you’re going to be able to drive across the country, and you’re going to get your charge for free the entire way.” By the way, none of those charging stations existed at that point, but he did lay that vision out. He also said, “Look, here’s the thing you’ll put in your garage, you know, and it’ll hook up, and here’s how much it will cost.” And then within a year, he had people who were putting these things in their garages, and he was putting the charging stations, the super chargers were up, and it worked. He sold enough of the cars into that vision that he was actually able to afford to build all those charging stations. It’s painting the picture in a way that people can believe. It’s painting the picture that’s, by the way, consistent with reality. There has to be a substantive claim that the whole thing can work. It’s painting the picture in a way that people can believe. It’s painting the picture that’s, by the way, consistent with reality. There has to be a substantive claim that the whole thing can work. Honestly, I think the other thing is it has to attach to human psychology. This is the other thing that evangelistic sellers are really good at. So in sales-speak, evangelistic sellers are really good at qualifying. There are certain customers that are just not going to do new things and are focused on downside risk. They go to work every day, go home with their family, like, I don’t want to do anything that might cause me to look bad and get fired. And that’s a completely legitimate way to operate. A lot of people are like that. And so the evangelistic seller, one of things they do is they just qualify those people out. “I’m not going to spend any time with those people.” But what they find are the minority of people who are like, “I don’t want to spend my career just protecting downside. I would like to become known within my own company, as somebody who’s innovative, and in the future. And I would like to basically stake a career about myself on a new technology, and the nature of that career. But if it doesn’t work out, I’m going to look bad. But if it does work, wow, I’m going to look like a hero, and I’m going to get promoted, and I’m going to be the next CEO of the company.” The evangelist seller meets the early adopter buyer, who’s got the right psychological mindset. What’s super interesting is those people actually become very close. The salesperson then becomes what we call a concentrated seller. They become very tightly integrated into the lives of the sponsoring executives on the other side of the table. And they’re basically, fundamentally trying to make each other heroes in their respective organizations. They often end up extremely close because they’re on a shared mission to do something new. This is what we advise our companies to do. But like, that’s the process. Then it’s the gut check, which is like, okay, are those early adopters actually out there? Do they actually exist? Do they have the authority to actually make those kinds of decisions? Then it’s the gut check, which is like, okay, are those early adopters actually out there? Do they actually exist? Do they have the authority to actually make those kinds of decisions? Or at some point, right, if they don’t exist, that itself is an interesting market signal. If the early adopters don’t exist, it may just be time to start a new company in that market. So that’s the other thing that happens, is the founders are like, “Oh.” It’s like, imagine being Travis Kalanick, and trying to start Uber, and your first idea is, “I’m going to build taxi dispatch software, I’m going to try to sell it to taxicab companies.” And then you spend two years trying to get taxicab companies to buy this taxi dispatch software, and they’ll say, no. That is, literally, what happened. But you could very easily imagine that happening.The other thing that emerges out of this is people just decide to start the company. Question: What do you believe are some of the biggest challenges to getting new technologies and solutions adopted, particularly in the healthcare space? Marc: The general thing that happens, which is really relevant to all these healthcare markets, is the product works, and I can’t get paid. One form of the problem is I just can’t get paid. Like, literally, the customer is not going to pay for this product, because it’s going to be reimbursed. It’s a third party model, and it doesn’t matter how many patients want access if the insurance company is not going to pay for it. So that’s a particularly stark example of “can’t get paid.” There’s another example of “can’t get paid,” which is I just can’t get paid enough. We have a lot of companies that have a problem that I call “Too hungry to eat,” which is basically, imagine a starving person 10 feet away from a plate of filet mignon. But like, I’m starving and I don’t have the energy to pull myself to the plate. The Silicon Valley version of that is, “I have a great product, my customers really want it, but I’m charging very little money for it.” Usually, these are naive product founders who don’t quite understand business, and so they think if they charge less, they’ll sell more. But they actually charge less, and they end up selling less. The reason is because they don’t charge enough for the product. They’re not giving enough revenue back into the company. They’re not giving enough calories back into the company, dollars into the company, and then they can’t afford to hire the kinds of sales and marketing people to do the kinds of sale that we’re talking about. And then they just get stuck. It’s like the product works in theory, and the customers wanted in theory, but the company doesn’t have the internal funding. They’re not making enough money on each sale to be able to justify the cost of sale. This is actually a very funny conversation to have with the founder, because the conversation is so weird. It’s like, “Okay, tell us tell me about your product,” “Oh, it’s the best product ever, and machine learning and this and that, it revolutionized. It’s going to save our companies $10 million each in saved expenses.” And it’s like, “Okay, what are you charging for it?” “Fifty thousand dollars.” It’s like, “Well, you’re going to save them $10 million, why are you only charging $50,000?” “Well, because it’s going to be easy to sell. We’re going to sell it and move to the next customers.” And it’s like, “Well, what do you have to do to convince the customer to buy the thing that’s going to save them $10 million?” “Oh, we’ve got to send in, you know, eight people for, you know, six months.” “What does that cost?” “Well, it costs a million and a half bucks.” Okay, so congratulations. You’re now down $1.45 million in negative cash burn on every sale you make. That’s your strategy, right? And then you’re going to make it up in volume, right? What I’m describing is literally what we see happen. A lot of the time, it’s the founder themselves who’s actually on site with the customer. And it’s like, what’s their time worth? Because their time is getting sucked down. It’s like the entire future of the company is being, basically, bled out. And a big thing we always have here is, the principle is that you have to get paid. The customer has to pay for the thing. This is the thing with all the healthcare startups. You have to be able to decode the system. The principle is that you have to get paid. The customer has to pay for the thing. This is the thing with all the healthcare startups. You have to be able to decode the system. And then on top of that, what you really do in a lot of cases is raise prices. Which is weird, because technology is supposed to drive down prices, so what are you doing raising prices? Well, you have to make enough money per sale. The internal economics of your business have to be such that you make enough money per sale, so that you can afford to actually build the company, right? You can build the company, you can build the sales and marketing engine, you can get the thing known, you can get the thing adopted, you can get references. And then once you’re at scale, then you can start to drive the price down. Jorge: Yeah, and I would just add, in the healthcare realm, and this is an overgeneralization, but business model failures are often a lack of recognition that the person who will benefit from your solution is often not the buyer. You have this mismatch that often happens in the healthcare system where you’re targeting your customer, but there’s a different buyer. So that’s a very difficult thing. That can usually be addressed with a business model, but it has to be recognized. The second one is point solution versus complete solution. It’s very hard for a startup to Big Bang an A-to-Z solution. But oftentimes, that’s what a buyer needs, because they don’t need another point solution. So it’s figuring out what the insertion point is going to be for any particular innovation. And then the third one that we see with a lot of our startups, which they have to be very thoughtful as to how they approach it, is recognizing how you can introduce a new technology, without disrupting existing workflows. Because the job that happens in healthcare delivery is incredibly complex. So even if you have a better mousetrap, if that better mousetrap requires you to change the way you work, it’s very hard to implement. So those are I think the three big challenges that all of our entrepreneurs see, from business model standpoints. So if you can overcome those, I think you have a much better chance of having an innovation get adopted. Thank you for having us. Marc: Thanks, everybody."}

{"text":"Every Western institution was unprepared for the coronavirus pandemic, despite many prior warnings. This monumental failure of institutional effectiveness will reverberate for the rest of the decade, but it’s not too early to ask why, and what we need to do about it. Many of us would like to pin the cause on one political party or another, on one government or another. But the harsh reality is that it all failed—no Western country, or state, or city was prepared—and despite hard work and often extraordinary sacrifice by many people within these institutions. So the problem runs deeper than your favorite political opponent or your home nation. Part of the problem is clearly foresight, a failure of imagination. But the other part of the problem is what we didn’t *do* in advance, and what we’re failing to do now. And that is a failure of action, and specifically our widespread inability to *build*. Thanks for signing up. MANAGE MY SUBSCRIPTIONS By clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Privacy Policy We see this today with the things we urgently need but don’t have. We don’t have enough coronavirus tests, or test materials—including, amazingly, cotton swabs and common reagents. We don’t have enough ventilators, negative pressure rooms, and ICU beds. And we don’t have enough surgical masks, eye shields, and medical gowns—as I write this, New York City has put out a desperate call for rain ponchos to be used as medical gowns. Rain ponchos! In 2020! In America! We also don’t have therapies or a vaccine—despite, again, years of advance warning about bat-borne coronaviruses. Our scientists will hopefully invent therapies and a vaccine, but then we may not have the manufacturing factories required to scale their production. And even then, we’ll see if we can deploy therapies or a vaccine fast enough to matter—it took scientists 5 years to get regulatory testing approval for the new Ebola vaccine after that scourge’s 2014 outbreak, at the cost of many lives. In the U.S., we don’t even have the ability to get federal bailout money to the people and businesses that need it. Tens of millions of laid off workers and their families, and many millions of small businesses, are in serious trouble *right now*, and we have no direct method to transfer them money without potentially disastrous delays. A government that collects money from all its citizens and businesses each year has never built a system to distribute money to us when it’s needed most. Why do we not have these things? Medical equipment and financial conduits involve no rocket science whatsoever. At least therapies and vaccines are hard! Making masks and transferring money are not hard. We could have these things but we chose not to—specifically we chose not to have the mechanisms, the factories, the systems to make these things. We chose not to *build*. You don’t just see this smug complacency, this satisfaction with the status quo and the unwillingness to build, in the pandemic, or in healthcare generally. You see it throughout Western life, and specifically throughout American life. You see it in housing and the physical footprint of our cities. We can’t build nearly enough housing in our cities with surging economic potential—which results in crazily skyrocketing housing prices in places like San Francisco, making it nearly impossible for regular people to move in and take the jobs of the future. We also can’t build the cities themselves anymore. When the producers of HBO’s “Westworld” wanted to portray the American city of the future, they didn’t film in Seattle or Los Angeles or Austin—they went to Singapore. We should have gleaming skyscrapers and spectacular living environments in all our best cities at levels way beyond what we have now; where are they? You see it in education. We have top-end universities, yes, but with the capacity to teach only a microscopic percentage of the 4 million new 18 year olds in the U.S. each year, or the 120 million new 18 year olds in the world each year. Why not educate every 18 year old? Isn’t that the most important thing we can possibly do? Why not build a far larger number of universities, or scale the ones we have way up? The last major innovation in K-12 education was Montessori, which traces back to the 1960s; we’ve been doing education research that’s never reached practical deployment for 50 years since; why not build a lot more great K-12 schools using everything we now know? We know one-to-one tutoring can reliably increase education outcomes by two standard deviations (the Bloom two-sigma effect); we have the internet; why haven’t we built systems to match every young learner with an older tutor to dramatically improve student success? You see it in manufacturing. Contrary to conventional wisdom, American manufacturing output is higher than ever, but why has so much manufacturing been offshored to places with cheaper manual labor? We know how to build highly automated factories. We know the enormous number of higher paying jobs we would create to design and build and operate those factories. We know—and we’re experiencing right now!—the strategic problem of relying on offshore manufacturing of key goods. Why aren’t we building Elon Musk’s “alien dreadnoughts”—giant, gleaming, state of the art factories producing every conceivable kind of product, at the highest possible quality and lowest possible cost—all throughout our country? You see it in transportation. Where are the supersonic aircraft? Where are the millions of delivery drones? Where are the high speed trains, the soaring monorails, the hyperloops, and yes, the flying cars? Is the problem money? That seems hard to believe when we have the money to wage endless wars in the Middle East and repeatedly bail out incumbent banks, airlines, and carmakers. The federal government just passed a $2 trillion coronavirus rescue package in two weeks! Is the problem capitalism? I’m with Nicholas Stern when he says that capitalism is how we take care of people we don’t know—all of these fields are highly lucrative already and should be prime stomping grounds for capitalist investment, good both for the investor and the customers who are served. Is the problem technical competence? Clearly not, or we wouldn’t have the homes and skyscrapers, schools and hospitals, cars and trains, computers and smartphones, that we already have. The problem is desire. We need to *want* these things. The problem is inertia. We need to want these things more than we want to prevent these things. The problem is regulatory capture. We need to want new companies to build these things, even if incumbents don’t like it, even if only to force the incumbents to build these things. And the problem is will. We need to build these things. And we need to separate the imperative to build these things from ideology and politics. Both sides need to contribute to building. The right starts out in a more natural, albeit compromised, place. The right is generally pro production, but is too often corrupted by forces that hold back market-based competition and the building of things. The right must fight hard against crony capitalism, regulatory capture, ossified oligopolies, risk-inducing offshoring, and investor-friendly buybacks in lieu of customer-friendly (and, over a longer period of time, even more investor-friendly) innovation. It’s time for full-throated, unapologetic, uncompromised political support from the right for aggressive investment in new products, in new industries, in new factories, in new science, in big leaps forward. The left starts out with a stronger bias toward the public sector in many of these areas. To which I say, prove the superior model! Demonstrate that the public sector can build better hospitals, better schools, better transportation, better cities, better housing. Stop trying to protect the old, the entrenched, the irrelevant; commit the public sector fully to the future. Milton Friedman once said the great public sector mistake is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results. Instead of taking that as an insult, take it as a challenge—build new things and show the results! Show that new models of public sector healthcare can be inexpensive and effective—how about starting with the VA? When the next coronavirus comes along, blow us away! Even private universities like Harvard are lavished with public funding; why can’t 100,000 or 1 million students a year attend Harvard? Why shouldn’t regulators and taxpayers demand that Harvard build? Solve the climate crisis by building—energy experts say that all carbon-based electrical power generation on the planet could be replaced by a few thousand new zero-emission nuclear reactors, so let’s build those. Maybe we can start with 10 new reactors? Then 100? Then the rest? In fact, I think building is how we reboot the American dream. The things we build in huge quantities, like computers and TVs, drop rapidly in price. The things we don’t, like housing, schools, and hospitals, skyrocket in price. What’s the American dream? The opportunity to have a home of your own, and a family you can provide for. We need to break the rapidly escalating price curves for housing, education, and healthcare, to make sure that every American can realize the dream, and the only way to do that is to build. Building isn’t easy, or we’d already be doing all this. We need to demand more of our political leaders, of our CEOs, our entrepreneurs, our investors. We need to demand more of our culture, of our society. And we need to demand more from one another. We’re all necessary, and we can all contribute, to building. Every step of the way, to everyone around us, we should be asking the question, what are you building? What are you building directly, or helping other people to build, or teaching other people to build, or taking care of people who are building? If the work you’re doing isn’t either leading to something being built or taking care of people directly, we’ve failed you, and we need to get you into a position, an occupation, a career where you can contribute to building. There are always outstanding people in even the most broken systems—we need to get all the talent we can on the biggest problems we have, and on building the answers to those problems. I expect this essay to be the target of criticism. Here’s a modest proposal to my critics. Instead of attacking my ideas of what to build, conceive your own! What do you think we should build? There’s an excellent chance I’ll agree with you. Our nation and our civilization were built on production, on building. Our forefathers and foremothers built roads and trains, farms and factories, then the computer, the microchip, the smartphone, and uncounted thousands of other things that we now take for granted, that are all around us, that define our lives and provide for our well-being. There is only one way to honor their legacy and to create the future we want for our own children and grandchildren, and that’s to build."}
{"text":"Welcome, Sriram Krishnan, our newest general partner, to Andreessen Horowitz! Sriram is a well-known and much-loved figure in the technology world of Silicon Valley and beyond. His product career spans four of the great companies of our era: Microsoft, Facebook, Snap, and Twitter. But in addition to building, leading, or overseeing such products as Facebook Audience Network, Twitter’s home timeline and trending topics, and others, Sriram has also become a coach, mentor, and advisor to a new generation of up-and-coming founders and quality companies such as Cameo, Figma, Notion, and Scale. In addition, Sriram generously shares understandings and insights broadening the world of tech through his media initiatives in the form of the “Observer Effect” interview series (I participated in the first one); “The Good Time Show” on Clubhouse (which I also join among others); and his new video channel as well. But perhaps most saliently, Sriram has spent the last 9 months consulting with us on an important new community project you’ll hear more about soon. Sriram’s skills and experiences — from product to counsel to content — make him a perfect general partner for a16z, where he will be joining our consumer team alongside Andrew, Connie, and Jeff to make social and other investments. I’ve now known Sriram for years, as have much of the firm. In that time, I’ve grown to respect his optimism and ability to look for the good in people — which is critical in a job like ours, where most companies fail; teams may pivot many times on their journey to product-market fit; and where it’s hard to be focused on what can go right vs. what can go wrong. This is also the macro story of technology innovation. But I also appreciate, at a micro level, how he pushes my thinking, too: He and I routinely have a discussion that goes like this — Marc: “That person is terrible!” Sriram: “No, no, I’ve met him, he’s actually a good person.” Me: “How can you possibly say that?” Sriram always immediately responds with a detailed explanation of all the positive attributes I’ve been missing, and he’s usually right. And even when it’s really hard to see the good in someone — and to be clear, sometimes it’s not deserved — he tries to keep the whole picture in mind.

{"text":"These are edited highlights from a recent Clubhouse discussion among Hadrian founder and CEO Chris Power, a16z partners Katherine Boyle and Marc Andreessen, and Not Boring newsletter author Packy McCormick. The dialogue here is part of a broader discussion that touches on a number of issues related to launching a modern manufacturing business, including software design principles, finding the right balance between automation and human labor, and why we began offshoring so much to begin with. You can listen to the entire discussion on a16z Live. KATHERINE BOYLE: Why is it so hard to get precision parts made in aerospace and defense? What does the American industrial defense base look like in terms of how many shops there are and the types of people who run them? CHRIS POWER: People don’t realize that every single advanced manufacturing company — whether they’re making rockets, satellites, jets, drones, or energy for climate change — outsources about 80% to 90% of their custom parts. This isn’t like automotive where you’re printing 1,000 widgets to go on a Ford. This is “Hey, we need five crazy complex-geometry parts that are going on a rocket.” It’s about $40 or $50 billion in spend that’s coming out of these space, defense, and other advanced manufacturers going into a domestic supply chain, but it’s being routed through 3,000 or so small, owner-operated high-precision machine shops. So, in aggregate, it’s a huge industry, but it’s incredibly fragmented. You’ve really got 98% of that base doing less than $10 million in revenue. And it’s real mom-and-pop — usually, there’s a machinist who’s the owner who runs the business, and maybe no more than 15 employees. This was a legacy holdover from the first space race in the Cold War, because this is how the whole space and defense industrial base got built up. And it worked very well for a very long time. Actually, I have a lot of respect for these business owners, and part of how I want to play out Hadrian is making sure that they’ve got a path to come along on the journey with us. But the reality is that as customers have started moving faster, as you’ve seen new space and new defense companies speed up to Silicon Valley pace, all the legacy primes have to come up to that speed with them. The supply chain is just built around 10- to 12-week lead times, with a very low quality bar, low customer service bar, and incredibly low NPS. And it just got to a breaking point over the last couple of years where new space companies that are trying to move super fast were just not getting the experience they wanted out of these machine shops. Really, the entire advanced manufacturing base of the U.S. is sitting on this house of cards of these 3,000 small businesses. The real problem for the country, though, is that the average age of an owner of one of these machine shops is about 60, and the average age of a worker is about 55. So over the next decade — as we butt heads with China, and as we’re trying to win “space race 2” — because of the demographics and people reaching retirement age, the supply base is just going to get worse. It’s a real hidden problem that no one really knows about. You look at all these advanced rocket companies and say, “Well, the supply chain must be really slick,” when, in fact, it’s a complete disaster. We can do it — it’s America, it’s going to be fine — but it’s not going to be as simple as grabbing 500 people from TSMC, importing them, and training everybody. Because that’s just not how you do things at scale. PACKY McCORMICK: Someone mentioned to me recently that we’re in this four-year window where there’s an explosion in demand that makes these types of companies economically possible and necessary for the first time, really. Can you explain the why now on the demand side? Why is this such an exciting time in space and defense? KATHERINE BOYLE: On the defense side, it’s definitely true that the time to build is now. I don’t know that it’s a four-year window; I actually think in some ways there’s a little bit more of a time crunch, because a lot of the companies that have raised capital over the last five years to serve the Department of Defense — in this hardware-software hybrid mission that they’ve been pursuing with startups — are trying to get out of what we refer to and what the DoD refers to as the “valley of death.” That’s when a company goes through pilots with the DoD, they go through certain contracts with the DoD, and then they get to a point where they’re ready for production, where they’re ready to really ramp up — and the DoD doesn’t give them contracts. On the defense side, what makes it a very critical time is that there’s been a funding glut, in many ways, of a lot of defense-related startups that are hardware-software hybrids or drone companies that are trying to work with the DoD. And there’s a question of how large these companies can get to get really into being prime contractors, or selling as a program of record. I think it’s different in the commercial space. But I definitely think we’re in a unique time where a ton of capital, and a lot of talent, has gone to these companies. People are excited to work in defense — aerospace and defense has never been more exciting for people coming out of school, even for people who may not have wanted to work on the defense side, say, five or 10 years ago. So this is a unique moment in time where we have the opportunity to really invest in shoring up these capabilities. CHRIS POWER: I think as a startup, you can back out of the problem and think about how you build massive amounts of market share in a fragmented industry. If you look at the best venture capital-backed companies, the pattern is always the same, where the first batch of customers that gets them to half a billion in revenue is new and fast-growing. You want to generate as many tailwinds as possible. In the space and defense market four years ago, for every program of record the contracts for those parts would have been locked in for the last 20 years. (They’re not even contractual — it’s just so hard to resource a part from one factory to another because of the quality standards, that there’s a real barrier to that revenue shifting.) Whereas four years ago you start seeing all these new space companies, and they are trying to move so fast and they’re generating a bunch of net new spend that, as a startup, you can go grab while you wait for the long tail of spend to unlock. You see something similar with, say, HR software. How do you build a PeopleSoft competitor? You have to start with the batch of customers that need onboarding software and are growing fast, and then grab onto those. And then you eventually build into all these enterprise sales cycles. So if you started Hadrian five years ago, there would not have been enough net new spend and customer pain to really get us accelerated to the point where we could build a huge, really exciting business and attract the talent and the capital. The reason it makes sense now is because the long tail of the spend, maybe an extra $25 billion, is inevitably going to unlock for the first time in 30 years, because of the demographics of the retirement age and all these competitive pressures on our customers. That’s why now is the right time to do it. But if you started this probably two years later, you’re dead. If you started it two years earlier, probably there’s not enough space companies to fund the initial revenue. MARC ANDREESSEN: There’s a whole bunch to it. It is flat-out easier to build companies that are just software — it just is. I think that’s even more the case today with all the supply chain issues. Anything hardware-related has lots of potential issues that, for a startup, can be very bad. It’s very easy for hardware startups to go under, so building anything with hardware is definitely playing in hard mode. The other big issue we think about a lot is that incumbents have a lot of power. Incumbents in many complex industries are organized into either a monopoly or some form of oligopoly cartel; they’re frequently intertangled with the government; and they’ve achieved what’s called regulatory capture. So they basically have taken over their regulatory bodies at the government level or at the industry level, and they have a fair amount of power to keep new entrants out. On the other side, the pattern is just very clear: The industries that we’re talking about are both really important and there needs to be significant advances. Aerospace and defense are industries that really matter to the industrial base of many countries, to the economy, and to the future standard of living for people all over the planet. And these markets are big. When you get out of the pure software world and into these other markets, what you find is they’re generally much bigger slices of GDP. The numbers involved are just staggering, so the prize is very large. I always think about it in terms of whether there’s a macro strategy to be able to go take one of these big markets? And then, is there a very specific entry strategy? Is there a tip of the spear — some kind of technological change or methodological change or economic change — where there’s reason to believe there’s a seam that you can inject into and get started? That seam might be a new technology, a new approach, or a new approach to an underserved part of the market. But you need to have some very specific theory on how to enter. Another question is the people question, which is ultimately the most important question of all. What kind of founding team, and what kind of executive team and customer service team, do you need to build to be able to go into these markets? When you put a stake in the ground and you say, “I’m going to build a new car company” or “I’m going to build a new rocket company,” if you really push that hard and you start with the right team, you can recruit the best and the brightest from all around the world. And you can basically get all of the fired-up, sharp, and energetic people out of the incumbents, who really want to do new things to come work with you. You can basically take the talent. There’s a new kind of entrepreneur emerging that has the complete skill set, and then there are these new kinds of teams forming that didn’t really exist in the past, that I think are really exciting. We’re bullish on the idea. These startups will continue to be the startups in hard mode: they will have more drama, they will raise more money, they will spend more money, they will run higher octane, they will have greater risk, some of them won’t work. But the opportunities are so big that the ones that do work and the teams that can pull it off are going to build really amazing things. CHRIS POWER: We’re seeing this decline in people — software engineers, especially — who are sick of working on optimizing ads or building dog-walking apps. This is a real moment in history where people actually want to work at Hadrian because of the mission, but also they get to build software that affects the physical world and they can see it the next day, versus seeing it through 100 layers of abstraction. If we were just a SaaS company, my God, would I be sleeping more. But another interesting thing if you have this wedge strategy that leads into a big market and you time it right, is you solve the Lindy problem. And the Lindy problem, as I see it, is functionally that as a startup you want to grow very fast on an exponential curve, but the Lindy effect is such that the faster you grow, the faster you fall. If you nail this strategy correctly, you have this wedge with which you get the startup growth, but if you lead into a larger sector where the average company that you’re disrupting has been around for 30 to 40 years, you should get this massive tailwind that leads into a 100-year company. Because it might take you a couple of years to get a billion in revenue, but maybe 20 years to get to the full 40 billion. I think this is what you’re going to see with companies like FlexPort. Are they the fastest growing company of all time? No. But will that company potentially be around for 100 years and be very hard to disrupt once they reach maturity? Probably yes. You’ve got to be really intentional about starting that sort of a company. There’s three phases: There’s the first five years, then the next 30, and then there’s thinking about how you hand it over to the next generation in year 50. That’s how I think about timing and building massive companies, as well. You could argue that the biggest thing that Elon Musk has done with SpaceX, for the country, is not SpaceX. It’s the fact that they trained thousands of aerospace engineers who were 25 and now 30, and now are starting all these companies. PACKY McCORMICK: Why is this the thing to work on for the next 35 years? That’s a huge commitment to make. What’s at stake, and what’s important for people to realize? CHRIS POWER: The Planet Labs co-founders have this concept of an “Archimedes company,” which is one that, by being as financially successful as possible, also has knock-on effects to the world. The mission is perfectly aligned with the balance sheet. Because, often, what you get are mission-driven companies that try to do their mission, but it’s in conflict with them being financially successful. So I was obsessed with finding, in the American industrial space, an Archimedes’ lever of a company, where if you build it and pull it off, you can have an outsized impact on something that you really care about. And as an Australian, I was seeing the rise of Chinese influence across the world. I’m a big student of history, and I’m a firm believer in reserve currency and that the world changes every roughly 100 years. We’re clearly in that trap of the global order potentially changing. And if you look back at history, the thing that wins wars, or prevents wars from starting, is basically peace through strength. But it’s not just who has the best fighter jet. It’s how many fighter jets can we make and what’s the replenishment strategy? If you just look at the dynamics in space and defense in America, you realize that the supply base is on the decline. You think about why 50% of the F16s are grounded because they don’t have parts; they’re cannibalizing other planes to get parts. And if you dig five layers deep, it’s not turtles all the way down — it’s Bob’s Machine Shop all the way down. In this decade, as we settle the solar system, I would like to help ensure it is largely under a free, peaceful world order. MARC ANDREESSEN: There was this narrative for 20 years or so, between the mid to late ‘90s to maybe five years ago, which was basically the “cloudification” of manufacturing. It’s this idea that manufacturing is a thing that can be abstracted away and offshored. A lot of it moved to China, specifically. A lot of people, I think, have this mental image of this “China manufacturing cloud” — stuff happens in China, they just build this stuff and send back finished products, and there’s not much more to it than that — and, of course, those of us who have worked in or invested in hardware businesses know that that’s not quite how it works. And then, of course, there’s political and economic tension and controversy over all this offshoring in the last 20 years. Calling it “globalization” is the positive framing, and then the “offshoring or hollowing out of American manufacturing” is the negative framing. This is a topic that always comes up in politics. In the last few years, for a variety of reasons, it feels like that conversation in the U.S. has really shifted. I alluded to this in my Build essay, which is that maybe some of that made sense for a while, but maybe it’s gone too far. Both President Trump and then President Biden, in remarkably similar language, have basically said it’s time to reverse that process and it’s time to bring manufacturing back to the U.S. for a variety of reasons — economic reasons, but also national security reasons. There’s an easy narrative there, which is “Oh, we can just bring it all back.” You hear this a lot now with the Russia situation. It’s like we’re going to move into this bipolar/multipolar world. We’re no longer going to be reliant on Russia and its natural resources. We’re not going to be reliant on Chinese manufacturing. We’re just going to be able to do everything domestically, and you’ll have a more segmented or isolated world. But maybe that picture is also too abstract — the global supply chains are so complex, and so integrated, and there are so many parts that constitute any finished product, that reshoring manufacturing is actually going to be much harder than people think. How does one analyze all that, and where will this all land, say, 10 years from now? CHRIS POWER: In terms of reshoring manufacturing, it is significantly harder than people think it is. It’s less of a supply chain problem and more of a culture and human problem. The first problem is obvious. In the way you train people and the way you learn skills, you cannot skip any of the ladders. You cannot take a workforce that’s used to making widgets for Toyota and get them to run a semiconductor factory. There is no training. You have to go up these complexity rungs in skills in a human population. The only thing you can optimize for is how fast you can climb those rungs. You absolutely just can’t skip to the top. So reshoring manufacturing is not as simple as, “Hey, let’s bring pharma back and let’s bring semiconductors back.” That’s only successful if you can either import the talent wholesale, or if you have sub-industries of manufacturing complexity that generate the talent that can actually do the highly complex stuff. We lost that population of people and lost our starting base when we offshored all the simple stuff. The other thing, which is a bit more esoteric, is that when we outsourced manufacturing we lost this industry that naturally generates serious people. And what’s interesting is that we build up society in these layers of abstraction, but manufacturing is one of those industries where because you make contact with reality every single day, you can’t hide from the realities of how the real world works. So having a big manufacturing population actually generates a ton of serious people who, when they are 50 and in Congress, are making really rational decisions that are grounded in real-world experience. Whereas if you remove manufacturing or other hardcore industries from the equation, you have someone who’s now 50 and who’s grown up having lived a very easy life, and they’re making decisions that pattern match off that easy life — not off of making contact with reality every single day. We can do it — it’s America, it’s going to be fine — but it’s not going to be as simple as grabbing 500 people from TSMC, importing them, and training everybody. Because that’s just not how you do things at scale. It’s just not how the world works. You could argue that the biggest thing that Elon Musk has done with SpaceX, for the country, is not SpaceX. It’s the fact that they trained thousands of aerospace engineers who were 25 and now 30, and now are starting all these companies. One of my hopes with Hadrian is that by building the company big enough, we teach people how to do this, and they go off and start all these other advanced manufacturing companies, because we’re teaching them the meta of how to build things in the real world. These startups will continue to be the startups in hard mode . . . But the opportunities are so big that the ones that do work and the teams that can pull it off are going to build really amazing things. PACKY McCORMICK: You want to make it as simple as possible for people to be able to do these complex jobs, without removing from the process autonomy, agency, and the feeling that they’re learning something and achieving something. How do you think about creating all of these jobs and making it possible for people to learn how to do these high-tech jobs in a scalable manner? CHRIS POWER: I think a lot of the complexity is primarily tribal knowledge. If you can instill tribal knowledge down to some checklist processes, that’s the first big step. Because then training is, “Hey, you’re learning how to cut metal on a saw. Here are the 10 steps. The first seven are probably easy, but if you get stuck on the last three, please ask for help.” Whereas most manufacturing training is, “Hey, apprentice under someone for three years, and maybe they’ll spend an hour vaguely teaching you about saw-cutting metal at night. But who knows.” So we structure it a lot. Within the factory, you start at shipping and receiving, then you go into tool building, then you go into repeat jobs and machining, and then you go into prototype machining. Then, you can be a quality inspector or a CAM programmer. So within each of those rungs of hourly pay bands and seniority, there’s enough short cliffs to jump where you can have people learning on the job. And building tools actually teaches you a lot about machining. So by the time you’re ready for a promotion, you’ve already learned half of it through the context of doing the previous rung in complexity and skill. The only way to rebuild America’s manufacturing workforce is to flood the first part of that funnel with thousands of people who are smart, young, maybe fix their car on the weekend, maybe play video games — and then have this self-learning process throughout the funnel. Because if you try to skip someone to the eighth stage of complexity, it takes three years to train them and they kind of die. We’re also aware that we can’t have our top 10 machinists spending six years training someone. But also that comes from great operating leaders from places like SpaceX and GE, who’ve learned these lessons of how to train people, and we’ve baked that philosophy into the software by listening to the people who have done this sort of en masse training before. PACKY McCORMICK: How do you build a culture where you bring all of these top people in — from a bunch of different backgrounds, levels of expertise, and areas of expertise — and get them working together in a cohesive manner? CHRIS POWER: I think the first thing is you have to hire the first batch of people who are as close to understanding the other world as possible. And then once you’ve got that core 10 or 12 people who really get it, you can build cultural reinforcements that set the stage so that anyone new coming in gets the play. People kind of laugh at me for this, but literally everyone in the company eats lunch together at the same table. So when people are hanging out, you’ve got maybe a top principal software engineer who was at Google having lunch or playing foosball or whatever with someone who’s coming from Chick-Fil-A, and is on an hourly wage working for us in the factory. You have to start with a core group of people that really get the vision and understand the root cause of why the culture is so bad on both sides. And then you really have to proactively fight the reversion to the mean of class dynamics, or whatever, inside the company. We really think intentionally about that, and it’s one of the more powerful things about Hadrian that we need to nurture over time. We have rejected top software engineering candidates purely because there’s a 5% to 10% risk that they’ll come in and walk all over the machinists. And now that we’ve got the core, we can show people what we’re doing and people can adopt our culture."}
{"text":"An Internet news outlet is asking a lot of people I know, and some I don’t, what I’ve been up to lately. Lord knows what they’ll ultimately publish, so I thought I’d just write this instead. We are in my 14th year of working to build our venture firm, Andreessen Horowitz. The overwhelming credit for a16z’s accomplishments goes to Ben and all our partners, but I do what I can to contribute. We are about to pass 500 employees, we’ve dramatically expanded our investing scope, and we’ve implemented an entirely new operating model on the other side of COVID. I could not be more proud of the firm and our colleagues, and we’re just getting started. I work extensively with our many portfolio companies and their teams—some where I’m on the board, but many where I’m not but can scrub in at key times, usually either when things are going really right or really wrong. I am stunned daily by the creativity and courage of our founders, and I love working with all of them. I spend much of the rest of my time helping to evaluate and close new investments. Most of the new investments a16z makes are not led by me, but I often partner with my colleagues to land new deals, and I occasionally lead an investment with a founding team I particularly connect with. I am currently on 12 boards, 9 private and 3 public, and try to always have at least one slot open for the next big thing. Mainly I try to learn a lot. For example, the political events of 2014-2016 made clear to me that I didn’t understand politics at all, so I deliberately withdrew from political engagement and fundraising and instead read my way back in history and as far to the political left and political right as I could. I’ll list some books I’ve found particularly interesting at the end. I keep up something of a public presence. I go back and forth on the virtues and faults of a daily social media presence. I write on occasion, and talk to interesting people in public.

{"text":"In this fireside chat from the American Dynamism Summit, a16z Cofounder and General Partner Marc Andreessen sits down with economist, podcaster, and polymath Tyler Cowen to discuss the state of innovation in America, from recent AI advances to growing support for nuclear power. They’ll explain why the future many people claim to want — a better economy, better quality of life, and a safer world — is only possible if America leads. Here is a transcript of their conversation: Tyler Cowen: Now, Marc. If your entrance music were to be Beethoven, which symphony and why? Marc Andreessen: For those of you who do care and know who Tyler Cowen is, this is how his podcasts start. This is how he intimidates his guests into submission. First of all, I just wanted to say, thank everybody for being here with us today. We’re really grateful that you were all able to spend time with us and hopefully it’s been useful. Second is, I’m gonna get new business cards printed up that say, “You either know who I am, or you don’t care.” Marc: Or both. I mean, how can you possibly…let’s see, I mean, I guess we have to rule out Beethoven’s 9th Symphony because that’s the official music of the European Union, is that right? Tyler: That’s correct. Marc: That’s the official anthem of the European Union. Marc: Which is just such a terrible mean thing for them to do to such a great piece of music like that. We should lodge a formal diplomatic protest. I guess, probably Beethoven’s 5th in retaliation. Tyler: I would peg you as the fifth. Tyler: Now, how will AI make our world different five years from now? What’s the most surprising way in which it will be different? Marc: Yeah, so there’s a great kind of breakdown on adoption of new technology that the science fiction author, Douglas Adams, wrote about years ago. He says any new technology is received differently by three different groups of people. If you’re below the age of 15, it’s just the way things have always been. If you’re between the ages of 15 and 35, it’s really cool and you might be able to get a job doing it. If you’re above the age of 35, it’s unholy and against the order of society and will destroy everything. AI, I think, so far is living up to that framework. What I would like to tell you is AI is gonna, you know, be completely transformative for education. I believe that it will. Having said that, I did recently roll out ChatGPT to my eight-year-old. And, you know, I was, like, very, very proud of myself because I was like, “Wow, this is just gonna be such a great educational resource for him.” And I felt like, you know, Prometheus bringing fire down from the mountain to my child. And I installed it on his laptop and said, you know, “Son, you know, this is the thing that you can talk to any time, and it will answer any question you have.” And he said, “Yeah.” I said, “No, this is, like, a big deal that answers questions.” He’s like, “Well, what else would you use a computer for?” And I was like, “Oh, God, I’m getting old.” So, I actually think there’s a pretty good prospect that, like, kids are just gonna, like, pick this up and run with it. I actually think that’s already happening, right? ChatGPT is fully out, you know, and barred and banging all these other things. And so, I think, you know, kids are gonna grow up with basically…you know, you could use various terms, assistant friend, coach, mentor, you know, tutor, but, you know, kids are gonna grow up in sort of this amazing kind of back-and-forth relationship with AI. And any time a kid is interested in something, if there’s not, you know, a teacher who can help with something or they don’t have a friend who’s interested in the same thing, they’ll be able to explore all kinds of ideas. And so I think it will be great for that. You know, I think it’s, obviously, gonna be totally transformative and feels like warfare and you already see that. You know, the concern, quite honestly, I actually wrote an essay a while ago on sort of why AI won’t destroy all the jobs, and the sort of the short version of it is because it’s illegal to do that because so many jobs in the modern economy require licensing and are regulated. And so, you know, I think the concern would be that there’s just so much, sort of, glue in the system now that prevents change and it’ll be very easy to sort of not have AI healthcare or, you know, AI education or whatever because, literally, some combination of, like, you know, doctor licensing, teacher unions and so forth will basically outlaw it. And so I think that’s the risk. Tyler: If we think of AI and its impact in sociological terms, large language models, who will gain in status and who will decline in status, and how should this affect how we think about policy? Marc: Yeah, so first of all, it’s important to qualify sort of exactly what’s going on with large language models, which is super interesting. And kind of this thing has happened that you kind of read about a lot in the press, which is kind of there was this general idea that there would be something called AI at some point, and then large language models appeared, and everybody said, “Aha, that’s AI,” just like we thought it would be. And then everybody sort of extrapolates out. And that’s true to a certain extent. The success of large language models is very unexpected in the field. And actually, the origin story of even ChatGPT is… this is not what OpenAI’s actually started to do. They started to do something different. And then there was actually one guy who…actually, his name is, I think, Alec Radford, and he literally was like off in the corner at OpenAI, like, working on this in 2018, 2019. And then it, basically, you know, was this revolution building on work that had been done at Google. So it was kind of this very surprising thing. And then it’s important to sort of qualify, like, how it works, because it’s not just like some sort of robot brain. You know, what it is, is you basically feed, essentially, ideally, all known human-generated information into a machine, and then you let it basically build a giant matrix of numbers and basically correlate everything. You know, in a nutshell, that’s what these things are. And then basically what happens is, when you ask it a question or if you ask it to, like, you know, make a drawing or something, it basically traverses. It essentially does a search. It does a search across, you know, basically all of these words and sentences and diagrams and books and photos and everything that human beings have created. And it sort of tries to find the optimal kind of path through that. And that’s how it sort of generates the answer that it gives you. And so philosophically, it’s kind of this really profound thing, I think, which is basically staring… It’s like you as an individual using this machine to kind of stare at the entirety of the creation of all human knowledge and then sort of have it played back at you. And so it sort of harnesses the creativity of, you know, thousands of years of human authors and artists and then sort of, derives, you know, new kinds of answers or new kinds of images or whatever. But fundamentally, you’re sort of in interaction with our civilization in a very profound way. In terms of who gains and who loses status, there’s actually a very interesting thing happening in the research right now. There’s a very interesting research question for the impact on job scale, for example, for people who work with words or work with images and are starting to use these technologies in the workforce. And sort of the question is, who benefits more? The high-skilled worker and think, you know, lawyer, doctor, accountant, whatever, graphic designer. The high-skilled person who uses these tools to become an additional quantum leap high-skilled. And that would be a theory of sort of separation. But the other scenario is the sort of average or even low-skilled worker who gets upgraded. And, of course, just, you know, kind of the nature of the economy. You know, there are kind of more people in the middle. And at least there’s been a series of research studies that have been coming back that it’s actually the uplift to average is actually more significant than the uplift to the high skill level. And so actually, what seems to be happening right now is it’s actually a compression by kind of lifting people up. And so I wouldn’t… You know, social questions are often a zero-sum game of who gains and who loses. But there may be something here where just a lot of people just get better at what they do. Tyler: Why is open-source AI in particular important for national security? Marc: Yeah. So, for a whole bunch of reasons. So, one is, it is really hard to do security without open source. And so there actually used to be…there’s actually two schools of thought on kind of information security, computer security broadly that have played out over the last 50 years. There was one school of security that says, “You wanna basically hide the source code.” And you wanna hide the source code precisely. And this seems intuitive because presumably you wanna hide the source code so that, you know, bad guys can’t find the flaws in it, right? And presumably that would be the safe way to do things. And then over the course of the last 30 or 40 years, basically, what’s evolved is the realization, you know, in the field, and I think very broadly, that actually that’s a mistake. In the software field we call that “security through obscurity,” right? It’s sort of, we hide the code, people can’t exploit it. The problem with it, of course, is, okay, but that means the flaws are still in there, right? And so if anybody actually gets to the code, they just basically have a complete index of all the problems. And there’s a whole bunch of ways for people to get to code. They hack in and… You know, it’s actually very easy to steal software code from a company. You hire the janitorial staff to stick a USB stick into a machine at 3 in the morning. So, like, you know, software companies are, like, very easily penetrated. And so it turned out security through obscurity was a very bad way to do it. The much more secure way to do it is actually open source. Basically, put the code in public and then basically, build the code in such a way that when it runs, it doesn’t matter whether somebody has access to the code, it’s still fully secure. And then you just have a lot more eyes on the code to discover the problems. And so in general, open source has turned out to be much more secure. And so I would start there. If we want secure systems, I think this is what we have to do. Tyler: What’s the biggest adjustment problem governments will face as AI progresses? For instance, if drug discovery goes up by 3x, all of a sudden, the FDA is overloaded. If regulatory comments are open, AI can write great regulatory comments. What does government have to do to get by in this new world? Marc: Yeah. So I think for every scenario, by the way, hopefully at least the first of those two scenarios happens. Maybe also the second. For anything like this, what there should be is there should be a corresponding phenomenon happening on the other side, right? And so the government, sort of correspondingly then should be using AI to evaluate new drugs, right? And so, company shows up with a new drug design, there should be AI assist to the FDA to help them evaluate new drugs. A regulatory agency that has public comments should have AI assist to be able to process all that information and be able to aggregate it and then be able to reply back to everybody. And this is kind of true of basically every possible… This is a very interesting thing about AI, sort of every possible threat you can think of AI posing, basically, there is a corresponding defense that has to get built. I’ll pick another one, cybersecurity people are quite, I think, legitimately concerned that AI is gonna make it easier to actually create and launch cybersecurity attacks. But correspondingly, there should be better defenses. There should be AI-based cybersecurity defenses. By the way, we see the exact same thing with drones. You know, weaponized AI, autonomous drones are clearly a threat, as we see in the world today. And so we need AI defenses against drones. The cynical view would be this is just a classic arms race, you know, attack-defense, attack-defense. And kind of, does the world get any better if there’s just more threats and more defenses? I think the positive way of looking at it is we probably need these defenses anyway, right? So even if we didn’t have AI drug discovery, I think we should be using AI to evaluate drugs. Even if we didn’t have AI drones, we should still have, you know, defense against standard missiles and against enemy aircraft. Even if we didn’t have AI-driven cyber-attacks, we should have AI-driven cyber defenses. And so I think this is an opportunity for the defenders to not only keep up, but also build better systems for the present-day threat landscape, also. Tyler: The Biden AI directive, what’s the best thing about it? What’s the worst thing about it? Marc: Yeah. So the best thing about it is it didn’t overtly attempt to kill AI. So that was good. You never know with these things, you know, how much teeth they’re gonna try to put into it. And then, of course, you know, there’s always the question of whether it stands up in court. But there were things that were being discussed in the process that were much worse and I think much more hostile to the technology than ended up being in it. So I think that’s good news. I think it was quite benign in terms of its just, like, flat out directives, which is good. You know, the issue with it, people have different opinions. The issue of it is it kind of greenlit essentially 15 different regulatory agencies to basically put AI under their purview in sort of undefined ways. And so, you know, we will now have, I think, a relatively protracted process of many regulators from many agencies without explicit authority in the domain, basically, inserting themselves into the space. And then, you know, presumably at some point, there will be a determination of who, you know, has purview over what. But it seems like we’re in for a period of quite a bit of confusion as a result. Tyler: So how much more green energy do we need to, in essence, fuel all of this AI, and where will it come from? What do you see the prospect is like, for the next 20 years? Marc: Yeah. So the good news with AI and the good news with also, by the way, with crypto, because there’s always a lot of controversy around crypto and Web3 and blockchain around energy use. The good thing with these technologies, the good news from energy is these systems lend themselves to centralization of data centers, right? And so if we need, you know, a million to go into 10 million, going to 100 million to a billion AI chips, you know, they could be distributed out all over the place, but they can also be highly centralized. And because you can highly centralize them, you can think not just in terms of building a server, you can think about building basically a data center that’s an integrated thing from the chip, basically, all the way to the building or to the complex of buildings. And then the way those modern data centers are built by the leading-edge companies now is they’re sort of built on day one with an integrated strategy for energy and for cooling. And, so, basically, any form of energy that you have, you know, that you could do in a very efficient way, in a very clean way, you know, or new energy technologies. You know, this AI is a use case for developing and deploying that kind of power. And so, you know, just building on what we’ve seen from Internet data centers, that could be geothermal, that could be hydroelectric, that could be nuclear fission, that could be nuclear fusion, solar, you know, wind, big battery packs and so forth. And so I think the aspirational hope would be this is sort of another catalyst to a more advanced rollout of energy. And even if there’s sort of net energy increase, the sort of motivation to get to higher levels of efficiency will be net good in helping us get to a better energy footprint. Tyler: And which of those energy sources, in your view, is most underrated? Marc: Oh, I mean, nuclear fission, for sure, is the most underrated today. And so, you know, there ought to be…yes, anyway, wave a magic wand. We ought to be doing what Richard Nixon proposed in 1971, right? We ought to build what he called project independence, which was to build 1,000 new nuclear power plants in the U.S. and then cut the entire U.S. grid over to nuclear and electricity, go to all-electric cars, do everything else. Richard Nixon’s other, you know, great corresponding, you know, creation of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, of course, guarantees that won’t happen. The plan is exactly on track. But we could. And so either with existing, you know, nuclear fission technology, or there’s actually a significant number, you know, now of new nuclear fission startups, as well as fusion startups working on new designs. And so this would certainly be a great use case for that. Tyler: So, if the nations that will do well in the future are strong in AI and strong in energy, thinking about this in terms of geopolitics, which countries rise in importance for better or worse? Marc: Yeah. So, okay, different things. So, I would add a couple more things to that, which is, which companies are in a position to best invent these new technologies? And then there’s a somewhat separate question of who’s in the best position to deploy because it doesn’t help you that much to invent it if you can’t deploy it. And so I would put that in there. But, I mean, look, I would give the U.S., like, very, very high marks on the invention side. You know, I think we’re the best. I think we have the best R&D innovation capability in the world in most fields. Not all, but most. And I think that’s certainly true of AI and I think that’s at least potentially true in energy. I don’t know whether it actually is, but it could be. And so, you know, we should be able to forge ahead on that. You know, China is clearly the other country with critical mass in all of this. And you know, and you could quibble about the level of invention versus sort of fast follow and talk about, you know, kind of IP acquisition, things like that. But, nevertheless, whatever your view is, they’re moving very quickly and aggressively and have critical mass, you know, a big internal domestic market, and a huge number of researchers and a lot of state support. So I think by and large, you know, we’re looking for sure on AI. And then I think probably also in energy, we’re probably looking at primarily a bipolar world for quite a while and then spheres of influence, you know, kind of going out. You know, I would say Europe is sort of a dark horse in a sort of a strange way, in that the EU seems absolutely determined to ban everything, to sort of put a blanket ban on capitalism and within that, ban AI and ban energy. But on the other hand, you know, we have this incredible AI company called Mistral, in France, which is probably the leading open-source AI company right now and one of the best AI companies in the world. And the French government has actually really been stepping up to help, you know, the ecosystem in Europe. And so I would actually like to see sort of a tripolar world. I’d like to see the EU kind of fully punch in, but I’m not sure how realistic that is. Tyler: So let’s say you’re in charge of speeding up deployment in the United States, what is it you do? State level, local level, feds? What should we all be doing? Marc: Of AI, specifically? Tyler: Everything, because it’s all increasingly interrelated, right? Tyler: AI, energy, biomedicine, everything. Marc: Yes. Yes. Well, and AI takes you straight to chips, which takes you straight to the Chips Act, which.. Marc: … is not yet resulted in the creation of any chip plants although it might someday. So yeah, I mean, look, the most basic observation is maybe the most banal, which is, you know, stagnation is a choice, decline is a choice. You know, as Tyler’s written at great length, you know, the U.S. economy downshifted its rate of technological change, you know, basically since the 1960s. And technological change as measured by productivity growth in the economy was much faster prior to the last 50 years than the most recent 50 years. And, you know, that’s just the result of just sort of, you know, you have big argument as to exactly what caused that, but a lot of it is just an imposition of just, like, you know, blankets and blankets and blankets of regulation and restrictions and controls and processes and procedures and all the rest of it. So, yeah. You know, and then you could start by saying, step one is, do no harm, and so, you know, this is our approach on AI regulation, which is, you know, don’t regulate the technology. Don’t regulate AI as a technology any more than you regulate microchips or software or anything like operating systems or databases. Instead, regulate the use cases. And the use cases are generally regulated anyway. It’s no more legal to field a new AI design drug without FDA approval than it is a standard design drug. And so apply the existing regulations as opposed to hamstringing the technology. You know, so that’s one, you know, energy exploitation. Again, and energy is just pure choice. Like, you know, we could be building, you know, 1,000 nuclear plants tomorrow. My favorite idea there, which always gets me in trouble, and so I can’t resist is, so the Democrats administration should give Koch Industries the contract to build 1,000 nuclear reactors, right? Everybody gets revenge on everybody else. The Democrats get Charles Koch to fix climate change, and then Charles gets all the money for the contracts. And so it’s kind of, everybody ends up happy. Nobody yet has bid on that idea when I pitched it. But maybe I’m not talking to the right people. So, you know, look, you know, we could be doing that. You know, we’ll see if we choose to. Look, the chips plant thing is gonna be fascinating to watch. There was this really, you know, we passed the CHIPS Act, and in theory, the funding is available. And, you know, the American chip companies are generally pretty aggressive, and I think trying pretty hard to build new capacity in the U.S. But there was this actually very outstanding article in the “New York Times” some months back by Ezra Klein, where he sort of goes through and he says, “Okay, even suppose the money is available to build chip plants, like, is it actually possible to build chip plants in the U.S.?” And he sort of talks about all of the different regulatory and legal, you know, basically requirements and obligations that get layered on top. And, you know, it was sort of speculating as to whether any of these plants will actually get built. And so again, I think we have here, we have just sort of a level of fundamental choice as a society which is, do we wanna build new things? I can’t say how exciting it’s been, at least on the West Coast, how exciting it’s been for Las Vegas to get the Sphere, because, like, it’s now impossible to visit Las Vegas without… Like, everybody’s always complaining. The Egyptians built the pyramids, like, where are our pyramids? And it’s, “Ah, we have a Sphere.” And so just like flying into Vegas just gets your juices flowing, like, gets you all fired up, because, like, this thing is, like, amazing. And by the way, I’m just talking about the view from the outside. I understand the thing on the inside is also amazing. And so, you know, we clearly can do that, you know, at least in Vegas. Where Ben lives now, like, in London, I think they just gave up on building the Sphere. So that’s the other side of it. And so, you know, we do have to decide whether we want these things to happen. You know, it’s a little bit dispiriting to see the liquid natural gas decision that just came down. Tyler: But are the roots of this stasis quite general and quite cultural? Because parents coddle their children much more, there are higher rates of mental illness amongst the young, young people, it seems, have less sex, along a lot of cultural variables. The percent of old music people listen to compared to new music, there seems to be a more general stagnation. So how would you pinpoint our loss of self-confidence or dynamism? Where’s that coming from? Marc: Yeah. Well, so first of all, to be clear, we’re very much in favor of young people not dating, because that’s very distracting from their work at our startups. So that works out fine. Fortunately, in our industry, we have a long experience with not having dating lives when we’re young. So that works out well. So, it’s not all bad. So it is really interesting, I mean, you know, the view is an experience… And look, Silicon Valley has, like, all kinds of problems. And we’re kind of a case study for a lot of the… I mean, look, it’s not like you can build anything in Silicon Valley, right? I mean, our politicians absolutely hate us, and they don’t let us do anything if they can avoid it. So, you know, we have our issues. The view from the valley is…yeah, a lot of kids are being brought up and trained to basically adopt a sort of fundamentally pessimistic or how to put it, like, stagnation-oriented inert, like, have very low expectations. You know, basically, you know, a lot of what passes for education now is kind of teaching people how to complain, which they’re very good at. The complaining has reached operatic levels lately. And so there is a lot of that. You know, having said that, look, I’m also, like, actually really optimistic, and in particular, I’m actually quite optimistic about the new generation coming up. I think that Gen Z, and then I think it’s Gen Alpha, and then it’s, whatever my eight-year-old is. We’re seeing more and more kids that are coming up and they’re being sort of exposed to a full load of basically, you know, programming, sort of cultural programming, education programming that says you should be depressed about everything, you should be upset about everything, you should have low ambitions, you shouldn’t try to do these things. And they’re coming out with sort of a very radical, you know, kind of hard shove in the other direction. And they’re coming up with just basically tremendous energy and tremendous enthusiasm to actually do things. And so… which is very natural, right? Because kids rebel. And so if the system is teaching stagnation, then at least some kids will come up the other way and decide they really wanna do things in the world. And so I think entrepreneurs in their 20s now are a lot better than certainly my generation, and they’re frankly more aggressive than the generation that preceded them, and they’re more ambitious. And so, no, you know, we’re dealing with a minority, not a majority. But I think there’s quite a bit… Like, yeah, every hour I get where I can spend with 20-year-olds is actually very encouraging. Tyler: One emotional sense I get from your walk on music, Beethoven’s 5th Symphony, is just that the stakes are remarkably high. Now, if we’re looking for indicators to keep track of whether, in essence, things are going your way, greater dynamism, freedom to build, willingness to build, American dynamism, what should we track? What should we look at? How do we know if things are going well? Marc: Yeah. So look, you know, I do not come here and do not come to the world with, like, comprehensive answers. I mean, so, you know, the overall answer is productivity growth in the economy, you know, is a great starting point. Economic growth is a great starting point. You know, so the overall questions are there. You know, most of our economy is dominated by, you know, incumbent institutions that, you know, have no intention, I don’t think, of changing or evolving unless they’re forced to. You know, certainly, most of the business world now is one form of oligopoly or another that sort of has various markets locked up. And so I don’t think there’s some magic bullet to hugely accelerate things. Having said that, I think attacking from the edges is the thing that can be done, which is basically what we do, what Silicon Valley does. And then, you know, when you attack from the edges the way that our entrepreneurs do… You know, look, a lot of the times they don’t succeed. You know, it’s a high-risk, you know, occupation with a lot of risk of failure. But when they succeed, you know, they can succeed spectacularly well. And a lot of our… I mean, we have companies in the American economy that were ventured backed in the 1970s, and actually even some that were ventured backed in the 1990s and 2000s, you know, that are now bigger than most national economies, right? And so, you know, when this…was it Apple? I think Apple’s market cap is bigger than the entire market cap of the German stock market. Tyler: I think that’s right. Marc: Just one company. And, you know, Apple was a venture-backed startup, two kids in a garage in 1976, not that long ago. It’s bigger than the entire German basic industrial public market. And so, you know, attack from the edges. Sometimes you can get really, really big results, sometimes, you know, you just prod the system. You know, sometimes you just, you know, spark people into reacting, and that pushes everything forward. And then the other question always is just, like, what are the tools, you know, from our standpoint, what are the tools that startups have in order to, sort of, try to really change things? And, you know, there’s a bunch of such tools, but there’s always two that really dominate. And one is just, what’s the magnitude of the technological change in the air that can be harnessed? And so we’re always looking for kind of the next super cycle, the next breakthrough technology, in which you can imagine 1,000 companies doing many different things, all kind of punching into incumbent markets. And AI certainly seems like one of those. And then, yeah, the other is just the sheer sort of animalistic ambition, energy, animal spirits of the entrepreneurs and of the teams that get built. And like I said, I think those are even… I think the best of the startups today are more aggressive, more ambitious, more capable. The people are better, they execute better than at least I’ve ever seen. So, I think that’s also quite positive. Tyler: Who’s a social thinker who helps you make sense of these trends? Marc: Yeah, my favorite is…James Burnham is my favorite who… Tyler: And why Burnham? Marc: Why Burnham? Yeah. So Burnham is a famous… Burnham is not famous, but he should be famous. He was a… Burnham is a fascinating story. He’s a thinker in the 20th century who talked a lot about these issues. He started out life as a lot of people do in the 1920s and ’30s as a dedicated Trotskyite, full-on communist. But he’s a very special guy. Burnham was a very brilliant guy. And so he was such a dedicated communist that he was close personal friends with Leon Trotsky, which is how you really know you really know how you’ve made it when you’re a communist. And he would have these, like, huge arguments with Trotsky, you know, which is not the safest thing in the world to do. But apparently, he got away with it. And a very enthusiastic communist revolutionary through the ’30s. And then sort of in the ’40s, he is, you know, a very smart guy and he started to figure out that was a bad path. And he went through this process of rethinking everything. And by the 1950s, he was so far to the right that he was actually a co-founder of “National Review Magazine” with William Buckley, who always said he was the intellectual kind of leading light at “National Review.” And so, you know, he’s got kind of works that he wrote that will accommodate the full spectrum of politics. But in his middle period, where he was trying to kind of figure out, this is like in the 1940s, he was trying to kind of figure out where things were going. And there were enormous questions in the 1940s because it was viewed as like a three-way, basically war for the future between communism on the far left, fascism on the far right, and then liberal democracy kind of floating around there somewhere. His best, most well-known book is called “The Managerial Revolution” which talks a lot about the issues we’ve been discussing. And it was written in, like, 1941. And it’s fascinating for many reasons, part of which is, he was still mad about communism. So a lot of it is he debunks communism in it. But also, you know, they didn’t know who was gonna win World War II. And so it talks about this battle of ideologies as if it were still an open topic, which is super interesting. But he did this very kind of sort of Marxian analysis of capitalism, and he made the observation that I see every day, which is there are fundamentally two types of capitalism. There’s the original model of capitalism, which he calls bourgeois capitalism, which you could think, like, Henry Ford is the archetype of that. So, a capitalist starts a company, runs the company, name on the door, ownership of the company, control of the company, you know, sort of dictator of the company, sort of, complete alignment of a company with an individual. And then he talks about this other emerging form of capitalism at that time called managerial capitalism. And in managerial capitalism, you think about today’s modern public companies, right? Think about Walmart or whatever, any public company where, you know, in theory, there are shareholders. But really what there are is there are millions and millions of shareholders that are incredibly dispersed. You know, who own small…everybody in this room owns some, you know, three shares of Walmart stock in a mutual fund somewhere. You don’t wake up in the morning wondering what’s happening to Walmart. It doesn’t even occur to you to think about yourself as an owner. And so what you get instead is this managerial class of, actually, both investors like fund managers, and then also executives and CEOs who actually run these companies. And they have control, but without ultimate responsibility, right? Without ultimate ownership. And the interesting thing he said about that is he said, “Look, managerialism is basically… it’s not that it’s good or bad. It’s sort of necessary because, you know, companies and institutions and governments and all the rest of it get to the point where they’re just too big and too complicated for one person to run everything.” And so you’re gonna have the emergence of this managerial class that’s gonna run things. But there’s a flip side of it, which is the people who are qualified to be managers of large organizations are not themselves the kind of people who become bourgeois capitalists. They’re the other kind of person. And so they’re often good at running things, but they generally don’t do new things. They generally don’t seek to disrupt, or seek to create, or seek to invent. And so, one way of thinking about kind of what’s happened in our system is, capitalism used to be bourgeois capitalism, it got replaced by managerial capitalism without actually changing the name. That won’t necessarily lead to stagnation. And by the way, that may be necessary that that happens because the systems are too complicated, but that won’t necessarily lead to stagnation. And then what you need is basically the resumption of bourgeois capitalism to come back in and kind of, at the very least, like, poke and prod everybody into action. And that, aspirationally, is what we do and what our startups do. Tyler: Marc Andreessen, thank you very much. Marc: Good. Great. Thank you, everybody."}
{"text":"[This is a post reacting to my business partner Marc Andreessen’s recent post about hiring, managing, promoting, and firing executives.] While I enjoyed Marc’s post on hiring and firing executives, I think that he unfairly dissed micromanagement. Everyone knows that the hyper-controlling manager with the severe personality disorder who micromanages every crummy decision is no fun to work for. However, it is wrong to condemn the practice of micromanagement on that basis. Specifically, there are times and situations where micromanaging executives is not just ok, but also the right thing to do. Andy Grove has an excellent explanation of this in his classic book High Output Management, where he describes a concept called “Task Relevant Maturity”. Andy explains that employees who are immature in a given task require detailed training and instruction. They need to be micromanaged. On the other hand, if an employee is relatively mature in a task, then it is counterproductive and annoying to manage the details of their work. This is also true when managing executives. Marc might think that he hires an executive because she has the experience and know-how to comprehensively do her job, so any detailed instruction would be unwise and unwarranted. Marc would be wrong about that. It turns out that even — and maybe especially — executives are also immature in certain tasks. It is almost always the case that a new executive will be immature in their understanding of your market, your technology, and your company — its personnel, processes, and culture. Will the new head of engineering at Ning walk in the door with Marc’s understanding of the development process or the technology base? Would it be better for this new head of engineering to make guesses and use her own best — not so good– judgment, or for Marc to review the first say 20 decisions until the new exec is fully up to speed? In reality — as opposed to Marc’s warped view of reality — it will be extremely helpful for Marc [if he were actually the CEO, which he is not] to meet with the new head of engineering daily when she comes on board and review all of her thinking and decisions. This level of micromanagement will accelerate her training and improve her long-term effectiveness. It will make her seem smarter to the rest of the organization which will build credibility and confidence while she comes up to speed. Micromanaging new executives is generally a good idea for a limited period of time. However, that is not the only time that it makes sense to micromanage executives. It turns out that just about every executive in the world has a few things that are seriously wrong with them. They have areas where they are truly deficient in judgment or skill set. That’s just life. Almost nobody is brilliant at everything. When hiring and when firing executives, you must therefore focus on strength rather than lack of weakness. Everybody has severe weaknesses even if you can’t see them yet. When managing, it’s often useful to micromanage and to provide remedial training around these weaknesses. Doing so may make the difference between an executive succeeding or failing. For example, you might have a brilliant engineering executive who generates excellent team loyalty, has terrific product judgment and makes the trains run on time. This same executive may be very poor at relating to the other functions in the company. She may generate far more than her share of cross-functional conflicts, cut herself off from critical information, and significantly impede your ability to sell and market effectively. Your alternatives are: (a) Macro-manage and give her an annual or quarterly objective to fix it, or… (b) Intensively micromanage her interactions until she learns the fundamental interpersonal skills required to be an effective executive. I am arguing that doing (a) will likely result in weak performance. The reason is that she very likely has no idea how to be effective with her peers. If somebody is an executive, it’s very likely that somewhere along the line somebody gave her feedback — perhaps abstractly — about all of her weaknesses. Yet the weakness remains. As a result, executives generally require more hands-on management than lower level employees to improve weak areas. So, micromanagement is like fine wine. A little at the right times will really enhance things; too much all the time and you’ll end up in rehab."}
{"text":"Marc Andreessen sat down with Fortune Managing Editor Andy Serwer to discuss the future of jobs, education and your favorite ride. What follows is an edited version of the conversation. BY MICHAEL V. COPELAND Andy Serwer: We all understand that the Internet revolution is inevitable at this point, but it’s also kind of controversial. There are scads of new jobs at Facebook and Twitter and other places, but what about the ones that are destroyed by the inroads of technology into every industry? Are you actually creating more than you’re destroying? Marc Andreessen: Jobs are critically important, but looking at economic change through the impact on jobs has always been a difficult way to think about economic progress. Let’s take a historical example. Once upon a time, 100 percent of the United States effectively was in agriculture, right? Now it’s down to 3 percent. Productivity in agriculture has exploded. Output has never been higher. The same thing happened in manufacturing 150 years ago or so. It would have been very easy to say, “Stop economic progress because what are all the farmers going to do if they can’t farm?” And of course, we didn’t stop the progress of mechanization and manufacturing, and our answer instead was the creation of new industries. AS: And the same story will play out with the Internet? MA: Right. So the jobs are something that happens in the end. But what happens first are improvements in consumer welfare. This is the part that doesn’t get much attention because jobs going away is a much scarier story. Improvements in consumer welfare are more diffuse, and it’s hard to specifically call them out. But it’s a really big deal. It’s a really big deal for people to have a lot more information. It’s a really big deal for people to be able to communicate and collaborate. One of the things that’s going to be huge in the future is the ability to get educated online. That’s a wave that’s going to hit in a major way in the next 20 years, and will be a huge improvement to consumer welfare all around the world. And so the gains to anybody with a screen and a network connection are absolutely phenomenal. It’s one of those things where everybody’s lives keep getting better. But you don’t get the creation without the destruction. And so there is a lot of turbulence, and will be a lot of turbulence. AS: So how should we think about navigating what for many will be a very bumpy ride ahead? MA:  A big part of the answer is the creation of new businesses and industries. Another big part is existing businesses taking advantage of the new technologies. A great example is any small business in the country that has a product or service that is relevant to people outside of its local area. Those businesses have always had an enormous problem actually ever reaching consumers, right? Say it’s a used bookstore, or an antique store. In the past you would market in the local newspaper and local radio station. Now you go on Google and you buy keyword advertising. You go on Facebook, you buy social advertising. And you can very cost effectively target people who are in the market for your product from all over the world. And then for all this to work, a lot of people will have to get retrained, they’ll have to develop new skills. Education is going to become even more important. People are going to have to be much more adaptable in this economy. This has been a trend for a long time; the days of lifetime employment are long since over. And the whole system of how everything works – from education to health care and housing – has to adapt to an era in which people are going to have a lot more jobs over the course of their career. When I was growing up in the ‘70s in Wisconsin that was a message everybody was drilling into me. Like, “Get ready. You’re not just going to have one job in your life.” I think at the time the average was seven jobs, and now it is up to 15 or 20. AS: How many are you up to? MA: I’m up to like six. So I’m definitely getting there. And of course some people just want this all to stop. Some people just say, “Just let me do what I’ve been doing, and don’t interfere with me.” But the counter-argument to that is always, “Okay, how much worse off should the rest of us be because you don’t want to change?” AS: How do ever stay up with all this change? I know it’s tough for everyone to stay up, but you’ve got to be that much further ahead than all of us. How do you do it? MA: I feel like I’m constantly falling behind. I feel like every day I’m out of the office I’m falling behind. At our venture capital firm we only invest in a sort of Silicon Valley style tech. We see 3,000 inbound deals a year. And those are inbound and coming through our referral network, so those are sort of prequalified. We can do maybe 15 or 20 investments out of the 3,000 a year. So I like to say our day job is crushing entrepreneurs’ hopes and dreams. Our main skill is saying “no,” and getting people to not hate us. It’s absolutely dizzying. But at the same time you have the privilege of seeing an amazing cross-section of innovation. As a consequence, it’s very hard not to be very optimistic because you just see so many sharp, bright people, with so many great ideas and with so much enthusiasm and determination to make the world a better place. And to build big, important businesses. AS: Did you ever imagine it was going to be like this 20-plus years ago when you were writing code for what would become the first web browser? MA: No. I never heard the term “venture capital” until I got to California. I got a job and landed in Silicon Valley, and I found out about this venture capital thing. And I was dumbstruck. “You mean there are people who will give you money to invent new things and start a company? Really? Seriously? It’s like wow! That’s really cool!”  And of course we got lucky. At Netscape we got funded by John Doerr, one of the legendary venture capitalists of all-time, and who is incredible to work with. And that’s what first got me into the system. AS: But you are building a different kind of VC firm in that system, and there are people out there who grouse about you guys being the new kids on the block – “That’s not the way we do things traditionally here in Silicon Valley. Who does he think he is?” – kind of stuff. So how are things different? MA: There’s a whole bunch of theories on how to build tech companies. A key one that we have is that it’s a long-term exercise. There’s nothing short-term about it. There’s nothing transactional about it. It’s finding the very, very special entrepreneurs and business builders. It’s backing them to the hilt, and it’s backing them through very difficult times. Every new company goes through tremendous challenges. Ask any entrepreneur in the Valley how their company’s going. “Oh, it’s going great. Everything’s fine.” But internally they’re always about to throw up. Because there’s always something going wrong. Some key employee is about to quit, or some new competitor has popped up, or some product has slipped or some customer is suing you or some crazy thing is happening. There’s nothing easy about building a business. And then you have to have a long time horizon. The great franchises get built over 10, 15 and 20 years. And the really great franchises like Hewlett Packard, IBM, Intel, Cisco and Oracle get built over 40 or 50 years. We just look at the history of the industry, and the companies that have had all the impact are the ones that had this kind of orientation. They had a founder, typically the founder running the company for decades, typically a real commitment to innovation, to R&D, which requires a very long time horizon. And they either had supportive investors, or they figured out how to force the non-supportive ones out. And so we think there is a model for how to do this. AS: How has the VC business changed since you arrived in the Valley? MA: Silicon Valley in the ‘80s and ‘90s got a little transactional. In particular companies started to go public very quickly. My company, Netscape, went public 18 months after we were founded, which is not something I would recommend to anybody ever, under any circumstances. And then of course it’s far harder to be a public company today for a new business than it was, you know, 20 years ago because of all the new regulations and all of the new pressures. AS: Have you actually tried to dissuade some of your portfolio companies from doing IPOs? MA: Yes. We do that all the time. We actually do two things. We try to talk them out of going public, and we try to talk them out of selling. Talking them out of going public is actually not that hard, just because it’s gotten so painful to be public these days. Talking them out of selling is actually equally hard, or maybe even harder. In the early stages the great franchise companies always get acquisition offers from the big tech companies that want to buy innovation. AS: So how do they see the wisdom in saying no? MA: If you know you’re going to be No.1 in your market, and if you know the market’s going to be large, then selling under any circumstances at any price is almost certainly a mistake. Because if you’re going to be No. 1 in a big market, you can build a very big company around that. It’s very, very common with these things that the founders want to punch out early. One of the things we try really hard to do is only back founders who have a long-term mentality. If they come in and have a slide that says, “Exit strategy, M&A,” whatever, we don’t invest. AS: What are the broad risks of disintermediation by the Internet on traditional industries and businesses? MA: The big thing the Internet does to business is it makes everything much more transparent. It makes information flow more easily than it used to. My favorite example of this is a sort of microeconomic example in the developing world involving subsistence farming. The typical experience of a subsistence farmer in many developing countries has been to grow some amount of corn, or some other crop, to be able to feed their family and then sell the excess to a wholesaler. Historically, though, subsistence farmers have not known what the market price is for the product that they grow and so the wholesaler’s been able to take advantage of that.  But take a subsistence farmer, give him an Android smartphone, all of a sudden he knows everything about the market price. All of a sudden, he has a better business because he now has transparency. In this example, the wholesaler starts to get disintermediated. MA: Jeff Bezos has this line where he says there’s really two kinds of businesses in the world: Those that try to charge consumers more, and those that try to charge consumers less, or try to save consumers money. I think about that more broadly. I reframe it as: There are businesses that have the mentality of adding value, and businesses that have the mentality of extracting value. And the Internet, I think, is an enormous benefit to the model of adding value, and it’s an enormous danger to the model of extracting value. I think you see that across the economy today. The music industry is a classic case in point. The whole piracy boom of music on the Internet really arose when music buyers essentially rose up in protest and said, “I want one song. Why am I being forced to pay $16 for the entire CD when all I want is one song that I can listen to online.” That’s when you had an earthquake hit the music industry. It was when consumers viewed the pricing to be fundamentally unfair. Car dealers are going through another version of this. Car buyers have never liked the process.  Maybe a few have, but most car buyers have not liked the process of having to go in and really get raked over the coals by a car dealer who takes advantage of the fact that consumers have no idea what the wholesale price of the car is. Now, after a little research online you can walk in armed with a car’s complete wholesale information and get a much better deal. In traditional business circles that kind of transparency gets viewed mostly as a threat. I think that’s unwarranted. I think the opportunities are just as large and probably larger, especially for businesses that have this view that their role in the world is to add value, is to bring consumers benefits. AS: So how many examples can you give us of old companies or old industries that have managed to make the transition as the internet brings more transparency to their businesses? MA: Let’s agree that transitions happen at various rates and speeds. Given that, I would say there are very positive things happening, even in the music business today. There are whole new revenue models in the music business. There is the subscription revenue model with services like Spotify. And while the Internet makes recorded information, anything that you can just pull up, much easier and much cheaper, it’s also had the effect of making live experiences actually more valuable. So the concert business in the music industry is actually booming, like 400 percent over the last 15 years. In e-commerce a lot of the retailers who distribute other people’s products are under enormous pressure, but retailers that make their own product, branded retailers, are really doing well with the Internet and taking advantage of it. So J. Crew or any other retailer that makes their own product all of a sudden has this whole new channel to be able to reach a much broader base of consumers. AS: Newspapers, magazines, television. How are these companies going to make money? What’s the future for them? MA: So this has been—the media industry is a microcosm of the changes that are happening and it’s been fascinating to watch. People are always going to love music, movies, TV and news  – it’s evergreen – people are always going to get value out of media. So it’s not a question of whether people want media or not. And in fact, global consumption of media is rising very fast. It’s a huge growth market. The challenge I think is that in newspapers, magazines and television in particular, and books to a certain extent, you had businesses that looked like they were content businesses, but were actually distribution businesses. They had controlled distribution rights on the newsstand, on your front porch, on the cable or broadcast dial. The problem is you remove the distribution constraint, all of a sudden you get a massive oversupply of content in each of those categories, and then of course prices come crashing down. And then the adjustment process for an incumbent that’s used to being a monopoly and has a high cost structure, then has a big problem relative to all the new entrants that have tiny cost structures or, you know, user-generated content, like YouTube, with no cost structure. The interesting thing that’s happening right now though is what you might call re-intermediation? AS: Re-intermediation? MA: Think of it as re-bundling. My old boss, Jim Barksdale, used to say there’s only two ways to make money in business: One is to bundle; the other is unbundle. Basically media is getting re-bundled. And so you’ve got these new models—Spotify in music, Netflix in video, and Amazon in eBooks, right? — that are re-bundling media together, and by the way, building very big companies around it, just very different kinds of companies than the ones that used to dominate. AS: What about marketing? How will companies reach their customers five years from now? MA: I know two things for sure. One: I know for sure that most offline marketing spend is going to move online in the next five to 10 years. The reason I know that for sure is because most consumer attention is moving online, just look at how people are spending their time. Offline media consumption generally is dropping, certainly on a relative basis, and increasingly on an absolute basis. And so if the majority of people’s time and attention is going to be online, then you’re going to want to reach them online. Two: The other thing I know is that the marketing spend hasn’t moved over yet, and it’s primarily my industry’s fault. The consumer Internet industry, really the consumer Internet media industry, has done a terrible job over the last 20 years at giving brands the marketing solutions that they need. Solutions that provide the level of trust – the provable metrics, audience segmentation and targeting – and the assurance that if something goes wrong it’ll be made good. All the things that traditional advertising companies have been very good at providing. In our world, too many companies try to just put all this stuff online and just make it a free-for-all. What that gets you are these online marketing auctions, these rock bottom CPMs, and these just terrible, useless metrics. And it’s just kind of been a sort of a race-to-the-bottom disaster. I actually think what happened in retrospect was companies in the Valley tried to implement advertising too quickly. We tried to do it too fast with banner ads, which never should have been the ad format. And so it’s our fault that the money hasn’t moved over. We haven’t been giving the advertisers what they need. What’s changed is companies, in particular Google, are starting to figure this out. Facebook has shown real progress, and now Twitter, and I think Pinterest, which is one of ours, will be the next stop. AS: The one knock on that kind of advertising is that no one ever decided to buy a BMW by going to Google. You might decide how and where to buy a BMW on Google, but the idea to buy the actual car, how would online advertising ever make that leap? MA: So this is what was so interesting with Google. Google is an extraordinarily impressive company, but most of Google’s success comes in direct marketing, not in brand advertising. They built this huge business out of direct marketing, which is only a small percentage of the overall advertising landscape. And so Google is a most direct substitution for direct mail, and of course much better. Google has never been that strong in brand advertising. Facebook as another instance is much stronger in brand advertising. So brand advertising on Facebook is working much better. Pinterest I think will be just as good or better for brand advertising. Pinterest is a sort of a glimmer of the brand-advertising environment of the future. And then I think Twitter is going to turn out to be actually very good for brand advertising, as well. It’s confusing at the moment because people just think of Twitter as just, you know, these little short text things, but I think it’s going to really grow up over the next few years and be very good for brand advertisers. And online advertising makes that leap. AS: Speaking of cars, you’ve talked about a shared economy where people will share cars. They won’t own cars. You see a little bit of that today, but is that really the way the world’s going? MA: So this is when I get really excited. This is another example of the impact of information transparency on markets. We are 90 years or so into cars. And we drive our cars around. And we own our cars. And then when we’re not in our cars they sit parked. So the average car is utilized maybe two hours out of the day. It sits idle for 90 percent of the time. The typical occupancy rate in the U.S. is about 1.2 passengers per car ride. And so even when the car is in motion, three-quarters of the seats are unfilled. And so you start to run this interesting kind of thought experiment, which is what if access to cars was just automatic? What if, whenever you needed a car, there it was? And what if other people who needed that same ride at that same time could just participate in that same ride? What if you could perfectly match supply and demand for transportation? Taken a step further, what if you could bring delivery into it? Two people were going to drive between towns, and there was also a package that needed to go. Let’s also put that in there so we can fill a seat with a package. Just run the thought experiment and say, “What if we could fully allocate all the cars, and then what if we could have the cars on the road all the time?” And of course the answer is a whole bunch of things fall out of it. You’d need far fewer cars. The number of cars on the road would plummet by 75 to 90 percent. You’d instantly solve problems like congestion. You’d instantly solve a huge part of the emissions problem. And you’d cause a huge reduction in the need for gas. And then you’d have this interesting other side effect where you wouldn’t need parking lots, at least not anywhere near to the extent that you do now. And so you could turn a lot of parking lots into parks. AS: But people love their cars. They have their stuff in their cars, the car seats for their baby. Their Frisbees, their golf clubs, it’s their second home. People aren’t going to give that up, are they? MA: Ask a kid. Take teenagers 20 years ago and ask them would they rather have a car or a computer? And the answer would have been 100 percent of the time they’d rather have a car, because a car represents freedom, right? Today, ask kids if they’d rather have a smartphone or a car if they had to pick and 100 percent would say smart phones. Because smart phones represent freedom. There’s a huge social behavior reorientation that’s already happening. And you can see it through that. And I’m not saying nobody can own cars. People want to own cars, they can own cars. But there is a new generation coming where freedom is defined by, “I can do anything I want, whenever I want. If I want a ride, I get a ride, but I don’t have to worry. I don’t have to make car payments. I don’t have to worry about insurance. I have complete flexibility.” That is freedom too. This story originally ran in Fortune."}
{"text":"Product-market fit is “the only thing that matters” early on in the startup journey, wrote Marc Andreessen in June 2007. Conventionally, product-market fit comes down to early signals that the market has voted your product as the best solution to its problem. In the enterprise, undeniable evidence of product-market fit shows up when an early cohort of evangelical customers are ready to pay more, new prospects are banging down the door to get access, and market demand far exceeds your ability to satisfy it. While you can “always feel when product/market fit isn’t happening” and when it is, reaching that fit requires both the right product and the gravitational force from the market pulling the product. If you’ve got product-market fit, you’ll likely have the revenue and customer traction to prove it. Product-market fit is not only knowing that your product solves the problem, but also that the market is waiting for you to convert latent demand into paying customers. But what if you really just have a sharp understanding of the right product for the right user… but still lack a sense of the greater market opportunity of all the right users? What if it remains to be seen if there is a market beyond the 200 people you’ve found who love your product? The honest version of “we’ve got product-market fit on a small cohort of very early power users” is “we’ve got product-user fit.” Product-User Fit: The extent to which you’ve built the right product for the right user. We often hear founders claim product-market fit victory once they have a sharp sense of the right product for the right user, but are in the very early days of getting the product in the hands of paying customers. Self-declared product-market fit is frequently part of the script when hiring promising talent, talking to customers, iterating on product, and of course, fundraising. At that point in the journey, you may have a sharp understanding of the right product for the right user, but still lack a sense of the greater market opportunity. And that’s perfectly fine! However, it means we’re not talking about product-market fit anymore, we’re really talking about product-user fit. Product-user fit is an important step in the journey to product-market fit, in which nailing the product to win over the right user is essential. The path from product-user fit to product-market fit is all about answering a few core questions: Who really wants this today? How many of those people are out in the wild? What else would it take in the product to turn non-users into users of our solution? What macro story must play out in the market to substantially shock market-wide demand? The jump from product-user fit to product-market fit is no trivial leap. Skipping what to focus on during the product-user fit stage and prematurely racing to spark the market adoption can actually decelerate your path to product-market fit. Forcing growth on a product that isn’t yet ready for broader adoption will not ultimately convert to a market of highly retained, happy users. And if you don’t listen to the early power users closely enough, you may never discover the insights that get you to a world-class product. Power users are the biggest sign of product-user fit. Making the leap from product-user fit to product-market fit is about listening to these users to evolve your product to attract more users. The conventional ways to observe product-market fit don’t tell us much when it comes to product-user fit. To understand product-user fit is to understand why your power users are power users, their user behavior, and how to evolve the product to create more power users. Power users are an early indicator that a company is really onto something. Maybe only a small segment of the entire user base remains active on a daily basis without any warning signals of churn, but even if power users account for only a narrow slice of the current user base, is there a big pool of users who look just like them out in the wild, waiting to adopt your product? Do you hear wishlist style feedback from users who tell you exactly what features would make them power users? Are your power users evangelically, bordering on annoyingly, trying to get other people to become users? Anyone who remembers talking to someone who owned a Tesla Roadster when it first came out, remembers those early users couldn’t stop talking about it. Think those users were showing off because Tesla was exclusive? Maybe, but Dropbox had the same rabid fanbase of early users. When exploring products that have only been in market for a short amount of time, the behavior of power users is often more interesting and important than any aggregate metrics. If the goal is to “make something people want,” then continuously talking to and observing early power users is the only way to really understand what drives both user retention and non-user activation. Pay particular attention to the following three things: Durable retention that proves users are here to stay: Since the early adopters often carry the strongest intent to experiment with different products, what features will win them over for the long run? Even if there aren’t many of them, are the early users sticking around? Are they using your product every single day? For those who churn, do you know why? And for others who pop up but never convert into using the product at all, what explains their rationale? Do users who activate with a work email reflect a stronger intent to stay than personal email addresses perusing Product Hunt every morning? Are there specific activity thresholds in the product that suck users in so deeply that they’re more likely to stick around? Engagement depth that maps to the natural user behavior: How well user behavior maps to what you’d expect if they really loved the product reveals if you’ve actually made the right product for the right user. How well does the frequency of user engagement map to the natural cadence of the underlying activity? Though it depends on the product, this dynamic should show up empirically in user frequency (e.g. DAU/MAU, WAU/MAU, L7, L30, etc) and activity depth (e.g. average session length, aggregate time per day, etc). Seeing users only in a product for an hour each week could be great for a tool in use during a 1:1 with their manager, but underwhelming for a communication workflow that happens daily. User testimony that evangelizes the value: Does the qualitative feedback from users reflect that they are desperate for your product? Do they talk about it as if it’s changed their lives at work? Is it up to 10x better than the status quo? Rahul at Superhuman anchors around how many users would respond “very disappointed” if they lost access to the product as a powerful signal. The gap between “disappointed” and “very disappointed” could be the difference between users who churn within a week and users who will put up with all the bugs in early versions of the product. Notice that none of these are a function of scale, or growth. That comes not when product fits the user, but when product fits the market. It’s far from easy to time the trade-off between delighting the current users and hunting for new users, but as with product-market fit, product-user fit is also something that you can feel when it’s right. And in enterprise startups, the journey from product-user fit to product-market fit tends to go: Build something people want. Then, explore how many other people also want that thing. Finally, get your product in their hands as fast as possible. In rare circumstances, market pull can be so overwhelmingly strong from day one that the ride from product-user fit to product-market fit goes by in a flash, with no perceptible middle ground between these two states. More likely, there will be a deliberate dance to iterate on the product against early user feedback, before you can ever spark gravitational pull from the market. With the wave of bottom-up adoption around enterprise software, more products are finding product-market fit that previously only found product-user fit. In the latest generation of enterprise technology, end users vote with their feet instead of procurement driven by centralized buyers sitting deep inside the IT department. With the world getting more sophisticated around adopting technology in general, the market opportunity for SaaS products is bigger than ever. In a self-service model, growth can come automatically with product-user fit with the race on to buy servers and scale to meet demand. Furthermore, Many highly specialized products – whether for a specific industry or narrow use case within a company – that wouldn’t have supported a high-growth company a decade ago can now unlock big markets if the product delivers enough value to the user. In almost every case, a key driver of bottom-up adoption is to listen to early power users closely in order to discover the insights that get you to a world-class product. As you progress down the roadmap, the right new features activate non-users into users, and then turn new users into power users. As you unlock more and more new users, eventually the product satisfies enough market demand to add up to a promising market opportunity. So while we still think of product-market fit as “the only thing that matters,” product-user fit is almost always the thing that matters right before the only thing that ultimately matters."}
